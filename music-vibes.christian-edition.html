        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Why do you listen to music in the first place?
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> I listen to music because music is life and 
	it energizes my spirit, my soul, my body. Music is a form 
	of exercise.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> I listen to music because its my “go-to” thing, 
	I use it to pray, play, vibe… music is my thing.
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> Does that mean that you listen to sad music also?
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b>I used to listen to sad music before but I
	 kinda stopped. I would say my “go-to” music is gospel 
	music because it tends to speak to my soul more and in 
	this our day and time, you have gospel music that actually
 	speaks to almost every aspect of life. Christian music has
	 a way of reaching you on the inside and they add more to 
	you.
	<br>
	<b>Have you noticed how Christian music has changed over 
	time? Especially in the use of musical instruments.</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b>Basically, everything is changing 
	according to times and seasons.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> What I really like about it is that, it 
	is not that the music is getting sinful because when we 
	listen to the lyrics, they still speak very strongly to 
	the soul. Can you remember in the bible, when the wall of 
	Jericho came down, those people knew music better than us.
	Although the kind of music has changed, the truth, the 
	power behind the music is still there, the spirit of God 
	is still in it and because we now have more instruments 
	coming in has not watered it down in any way. 
	<b>What kind of contemporary music do you listen to?</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> I believe these songs have a way of finding themselves 
	into our brain when we keep listening to the lyrics over 
	and over again. Even though I’m not good at putting lyrics
	 of songs into my head there’s still a line that would 
	stick to my brain. So, if I’m not listening to these bad, 
	bad words, I may find myself using slangs from them in 
	conversations.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Its popular, people say that the kinds 
	of songs we listen to actually affects our personality, 
	sometimes affects our actions, the way we talk. What’s 
	your view?
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> Let’s say you call yourself a Christian and 
	all, the songs you have on your phone are worldly music. 
	Worldly music in the sense that even the music, let’s say 
	your pastor is around you and your phone is about to ring 
	and you’ll just be like let me just put this thing on 
	vibration. Have you witnessed that scene before? Any music
	 you are listening to, I believe you shouldn’t be scared 
	if you call yourself a Christian, even if your phone should 
	ring amidst brethren, you should know that there’s no big 
	deal.
	<br><br>
	There’s a way music has a way of finding itself into our 
	body system, when you keep hearing it, our sense organs 
	are working together and before you 
	know, you begin to speak it out, act it out.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> We would agree that it affects our 
	personality but it depends on how much time you are giving
	 to it. Although, there are some songs that it doesn’t 
	depend on how much time we put into it but that we 
	shouldn’t even be listening to it in the first place. 
	<br>
	<b>Do you know any songs like this?</b>
	<br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> An example, there was a song that I was just
	 hearing “ponmo”, “ponmo”, I asked my friend and when he 
	told me the meaning of “ponmo”, I was like, this is 
	serious “ponmo”.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> I know someone who stopped wearing belt 
	because he was like “no belt gang”. The idea behind “no 
	belt” is being in prison, you know in prison, they don’t 
	put on belt. So, you know there’s like this dropout thing 
	that’s now going around like its not about… This person 
	that actually sang this song went to university. You are 
	a young person, you have not started university buy you 
	are like who school pay? No belt gang… haaa…
        <br><br>
        <b>Are there specific things that you find in a song and 
	immediately you know that 
	I’m not supposed to be listening to this?</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> : I believe that’s why we have the spirit 
	man that talks to us on things. There’s a level of 
	relationship you get to with God and you know that… your 
	spirit will just be telling you “No”, this is not right. 
	Immediately you have that unrest, just know that, that 
	song you are listening to is not right.
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> There are some things specifically in a 
	song that already you know, you should not be listening 
	to it. Examples are:
	<br>
	A song strongly promoting immorality
	<br>
	A song that promotes boasting, being prideful
	<br>
	A song promoting profanity
	<br>
	<b>Have you always filtered your songs?</b>
      	<br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> I can’t really say I’ve really changed.
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> I haven’t always being like this, 
	as a teenager I sang everything with my classmates.
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> Actually, this thing is about the mind. 
	There are sometimes you just want to dance, to express 
	yourself in the presence of God and probably, maybe you 
	use to listen to contemporary music before and this 
	particular dance has stuck to your brain and before you 
	know it you are dancing already. Will you now condemn 
	that person? This social media is serious, we need to be 
	careful as Christians, there’s a way it influences 
	the mind whether positively or negatively.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> This point is very valid and sensitive, 
	it brings us back to what we mentioned earlier in this 
	conversation. Songs have a way of finding themselves 
	into our brain when we keep listening to the lyrics over 
	and over again. A line here or there would stick to the 
	brain. So, we may find ourselves using slangs from them 
	in conversations or even bringing the dances into the 
	worship of God. You are right, social media influence is 
	serious and as Christians, we need to be careful on what 
	we spend our time on and how much of some content we allow 
	ourselves be exposed to whether by listening or watching.
	<br><br>
	I listened to someone once share that he had started 
	watching porn after he watched a music video and he saw 
	something then he had a desire to know more. At this point,
	 he was still struggling with it. It started when he was in 
	primary school and at the time he was sharing, he was 
	working and he was still struggling with something that 
	came up from a music video.
	<br><br>
	<b>In social events, weddings, convocations, anniversaries, 
	how do you react to songs you may not be okay with?</b>
	<br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> It’s a social gathering, you are not 
	the DJ. In a case like this, I try to distract myself, 
	talk to someone.
	<br><br>
        <h5><b>Last Words</b></h5>
	<br>
        <b>Guest:</b> Whatever is not edifying your body, your 
	spirit, your soul, whatever you have unrest about, 
	please avoid it and don’t do it, it has a way of 
	influencing your soul.
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> In our generation, we are being called to
	 being intentional about the kind of songs we listen to. 
	We can do gospel music, of course this is good because it 
	edifies our soul, it gives honor to God. Also, when we do 
	contemporary music, this is where sensitivity is required.
	 Many of us know the things that please God, we can keep 
	these things at the back of our minds and be intentional 
	about it, everything is step by step.
        <br><br>
        I hope you found this insightful.
        Please share with someone that needs to read it.
        <br><br>
        Much love! Besos!!<br><br><br><br>
