        <blockquote><strong>“If we go on and on with these 
            things, we will never feel enough. The point is, what do 
            you have? Yes, I understand your background has this, has 
            that. <b>No, your background is not you, your background 
            should not tie your back to the ground.</b> <b>Do not allow your 
            background to tie you down to the ground.</b>”</strong></blockquote>
        <br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Some persons develop insecurities based on 
        the background that they have come from. For example,
        economic background, family background. Whatever background 
        or upbringing that we have that has now affected our psychic 
        or the way we see ourselves. How can we deal with insecurities 
        that have come from this.
         <br><br>
         <b>Coach:</b> This is very unique because every child 
         goes through a particular background and upbringing. It 
         is said that <b>“Train up a child in the way he should go 
         and he will not depart from it.” And that’s why we say 
         that education is a major input in a nation because whatever 
         you train that child to be will form the core of the nation 
         eventually.</b> 
         <br><br>
         Coming back to the upbringing, the background. 
         The training a child receives is one, the criticism the 
         child is exposed to, the harshness, the attachment, the 
         acceptance from the parents and then the social status. 
        <br><br>
         I know of someone that schooled in a state university 
         in one of the western states and that was a problem for 
         him because he felt he was not a graduate of a federal 
         university in Nigeria whereas there are some other people 
         that feel inferior because they are not graduates of an 
         international university. <br><br>
         If we go on and on with these 
         things, we will never feel enough. The point is, what do 
         you have? Yes, I understand your background has this, has 
         that. <b>No, your background is not you, your background 
         should not tie your back to the ground.</b> <b>Do not allow your 
         background to tie you down to the ground.</b>
         <br><br>
         Your background is just a level. Now, you build on it. 
         Oh, yes, I didn’t go to a good school when I was growing up. 
         I hear you. Now, what do you do with what you have? Leverage, 
         build. Even if you are not able to build fast, do not let 
         that hinder you, tie you down. 
         <br><br>
         Its all in our minds, 
         its a feeling. Its one thing to begin to think that, 
         that will limit you, that will stop you. That person 
         right now is doing more than what many federal university students, 
         even many international graduates, he is doing better than them as 
         we speak. So, if he had stayed back in that insecurity of oh, 
         I didn’t have a good background educationally, he would never 
         have leveraged and being what he is today.
         <br><br>
         <blockquote><b>What I say to you today is, whatever be your background, 
         whatever be your upbringing, whatever be your exposure and 
         experiences. Do not stop there, do not look at it as a limit. 
         Look at it as an access to that future you want for yourself. 
         Change that thought process, change that mindset and help 
         yourself to pick up the pieces.</b>
        </blockquote>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Thank you!! Word! Word! Word! In summary, 
        our backgrounds do not define us. <b>It is what we do with what 
        we have as our background that actually matters. How do we 
        build on it? What we make out of it, not what it is.
        What it is was what was given to us but what do we do with it? 
        How do we build it.</b>
        <br><br>
        We don’t let our background define us, instead we build on it 
        and decide who we are going to be.
        <br><br>
        Some of us have inabilities, things that we cannot do or 
        we are no good at them. Sometimes, for some of us, it is 
        like we have weaknesses and because we have this weaknesses 
        or things we cannot do, it becomes obvious to other people 
        and they use it to label us or look at us in a kind of way 
        or talk about us in a kind of way or we ourselves recognize 
        that we are different from other people in that we can’t do 
        this thing that other people are doing. How do we deal with 
        insecurities in this kind of case?
        <br><br>
        <b>Coach:</b> Our <b>weaknesses or our inabilities do not 
        define us. No, they do not. I’ll like to come from the other angle, 
        what are your strengths?</b> I’m not saying you should use 
        your strength as a supplement or a cover for your weakness. 
        I’m saying that <b>your strengths are there because they are 
        your strongest points so, projects your strength, work on 
        your weaknesses.</b> You work on your weaknesses, they become 
        strengths overtime. 
        <br><br>
        I used to stutter, I said that before 
        and I still do sometimes but I’ve now understood that 
        weakness, that inability. I’ve now understood that when 
        this thing comes, it happens when I begin to talk so fast 
        and words begin to rush. When I see myself trying to stutter, 
        I take a pause, a break and I speak again. Sometimes, I slow 
        down and I pick my words or I change the thought process, I 
        say something else and go back to it. I could laugh, cos I’ve 
        now understood that weakness and I’ve worked on it. 
        <br><br>
        It wasn’t 
        easy but I had to do it for myself because I realize that I’m 
        a person that is going to speak to people and if I’m to speak 
        to people and I see my speech as a weakness then I will never 
        achieve my purpose in life. So, I had to rise up from that and 
        tell myself, You stutter, Yes, but you will still speak and make 
        impact by speaking to people. 
        <br><br>
        I take sessions, I've facilitated 
        trainings of one hour, two hours and I’m that person that stutters 
        yet, it doesn’t hinder my sessions because I have come to understand 
        who I am and, I have come to understand that weakness and I’ve worked 
        on that weakness. <b>So, this is it, work on that weakness.</b>
        <br><br>
        Now, many people will be tempted to try to cover it up 
        instead of working on it. <b>Cover it up, bury it but it 
        keeps on hurting you, hunting you. It keeps pulling you down. 
        Don’t do that to yourself. Deal with it,</b> identify it and tell 
        yourself, Yes, this thing is there. Now, what do I do about this 
        thing. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Remember that it is the mind. Once you can feed the mind 
        with the right information, when you have understood it, you 
        have given your mind the right information to deal with it, 
        when it comes, you will control it.</b> It could be anger that 
        is your weakness. You understand what triggers you, you 
        understand when those triggers become explosive and you 
        now understand what you can do when your triggers are there.
        So, once you’ve given yourself that information, you’ve 
        informed your mind with respect to your weakness then, 
        it is easy for you to handle that weakness, whatever 
        that weakness is.                
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Thank you, thank you.
         <br>
         <b>Coach:</b> Also, remember that no one is perfect. 
         That thing you look at in someone and say, that person 
         is perfect, they are just the right fit, I can’t stand beside 
         this person. Yes, the person may have that but there is 
         something you have that could make you look like that. 
         <b>So, Yes, the person has something you don’t have but you 
         have something that person does not have.</b> 
         <br><br>
         You may not know 
         it, the person may hide it and you may know it but you will 
         not even recognize it because you have looked at that person 
         as perfect. Now, no one is perfect, everybody has a strenght 
         or strenghts and weaknesses so, when you understand that, you 
         would see that your weakness is not negative, your weakness 
         is not a problem rather. <b>Your weakness is just an area of 
         improvement and development.</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Thank you so much. I would say that from 
        this whole conversation, <br>
        <blockquote> <b>Two things have really stood out for me. 
        The first one is that insecurity is premised 
        on a feeling, it is premised on perception and in all cases, 
        the root to changing it is changing how you see that situation 
        and <br><br>
        Secondly, know who you are, recognise 
        who you are, accept who you are. Don’t let someone else be the 
        person to tell you who you are or deliver to you who you are. 
        No, No, No. Be conscious of your strengths, be conscious of your 
        weaknesses, be conscious of your physical attributes, recognise 
        them, accept them, so when someone brings it to 
        you, you are not surprised, it doesn’t make you start feeling bad. 
        Improve on the negative parts. The ones you cannot change, 
        accept.</b></blockquote>
