        <blockquote><strong>“Nobody 
            made anybody so, there is nothing ideal. You are the 
            ideal you, you are the perfect you. Understand that. 
            Change those things in your mind, thought process, 
            <b>crush your inner critic</b>. That thing inside you telling 
            you that, "you’re not enough", "this thing is a disadvantage 
            to you", "this thing will hinder you", "this thing is not good 
            enough for you". No, crush it. <b>Speak back to the inner critic</b>, 
            and tell yourself No, I am perfect like this, my nose, 
            my eyes, my cheeks, my lips is the perfect size to make 
            me beautiful the way I am.”</strong></blockquote> 
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Starting with insecurities that come from failure or 
        negative experiences from the past. How do we come out of this?
        <br>
        <b>Coach:</b> Every form of insecurity whatever be its source is hinged
         on a feeling. Insecurity is a feeling of something, either doubt, 
         fear, anxiety. Its not every feeling that we have that we act on. 
         The question is what happened? What was not done right? What is the 
         reason why you were not accepted?
         <br><br>
         <b>TWTsBlog:</b> So, are you trying to say that when we do 
         experience rejection, in other to handle it and prevent 
         it from becoming an insecurity, we are not to focus on 
         the feeling we have from the rejection but to focus on 
         the “why was I rejected?” 
        <br><br>
        <b>Coach:</b> Oo Yes. Most times when people face rejection, 
        they start to think, dwell on it, feel low, what did I 
        do wrong, I am not good enough and things like that. 
        It further dampens them. You need to dive in better. 
        Go back, work and come back.
        Sometimes, rejection is not even about you. 
        The cause of the rejection dwells in the person that 
        rejected you. In that case, you just look for a better 
        place and try again. When we are able to articulate all 
        of that, we won’t fall into insecurity because of rejection.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Thank you so much. Sometimes, persons feel insecure 
        because of some physical attribute that they have, they can 
        see this physical attribute, they know it is there and sometimes 
        they themselves perceive it in some kind of way. Sometimes, 
        it is not even them, it is other people around that bring 
        these to their attention. 
        How do we deal with insecurities that comes from these?
         <br><br>
         <b>Coach:</b> A personal story. I have a gap tooth at the side 
         there and this was a problem for me growing up. I can say 
         it now because I now understand and I have walked out of 
         that insecurity. Then, I would not smile with my mouth open 
         because I felt my tooth wasn’t nice, so I close my mouth. 
         Whatever happens, I don’t smile out. Just imagine my nice 
         smile now. 
         <br><br>
         Also, I stutter sometimes and I began to feel 
         that since I stutter, I cannot speak so I avoided debates, 
         I avoided representing my class, quiz, presentation in 
         school because I felt I can’t do it because I stutter at times. 
         Now, look at me, I am a teacher trainer, I coach youths, 
         I coach people on mental health and wellbeing.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> How did you handle it?
        <br>
        <b>Coach:</b> <b>What you cannot change, you don’t bother about.</b> 
        Physical appearance that you can do nothing about, you 
        do not bother about. Some people may never get slim but 
        they are so bothered about their weight. There’s nothing 
        you can do about it. Be comfortable in your skin, it is you. 
        That’s who you are. 
        <br><br>
        The person that is slim is many times not slim 
        because she chooses to be slim. She has it in her genes, 
        she is ble to be slim. My eye is not white or yours are white. 
        That is you, this is me. It adds to my uniqueness. 
        So, <b>accept yourself,  be comfortable in your 
        skin and do not allow anybody talk you down.</b> You have 
        flat nose? Oh, thank you, it is beautiful.        
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> For someone that has lived with an insecurity 
        based off of a physical attribute for so long, <b>what 
        practical steps can this person take to start changing 
        the way they see themselves.</b>
         <br><br>
         <b>Coach:</b> This is simply the mind. 
         You have fed your mind with some information, 
         other people have fed your mind with some 
         information in form of comments, negative 
         criticism and all of that and it has informed 
         your mind to think that being short is a problem, 
         a disadvantage, is negative. 
         <br><br>
         No, your being short is you. Accept it that way. 
         Nobody is perfect in themselves, nobody has it all 
         together. Everybody has something or the other that 
         they wish they had. <b>We are not all made perfect. We 
         are made good.</b> Do you understand me? When God saw 
         creation, He said hmmmm… this is a good work. 
         <br><br>
         Whatever you see yourself as, that is the perfect you. 
         The issue is that there is a mindset formed about what is 
         perfect, the ideal, what should be. No, it is wrong. Nobody 
         made anybody so, there is nothing ideal. You are the 
         ideal you, you are the perfect you. Understand that. 
         <br><br>
         Change those things in your mind, thought process, 
         crush your inner critic. That thing inside you telling 
         you that you’re not enough, this thing is a disadvantage 
         to you, this thing will hinder you, this thing is not good 
         enough for you. No, crush it. Speak back to the inner critic, 
         and tell yourself No, I am perfect like this, my nose, 
         my eyes, my cheeks, my lips is the perfect size to make 
         me beautiful the way I am.
