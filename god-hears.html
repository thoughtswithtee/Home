        <blockquote><strong>See this woman... I, I myself is the resurrection 
	and The Life. And Jesus Christ said Lazarus come forth and that man
 	came out even with grave clothes on his face. It didn’t even matter that 
	he was tied up, it didn’t matter that He had grave clothes on 
	his face, that man still came out, straight up because that situation 
	had received life. 
        <br>
        It does not just even matter anything that has tied it down, 
        When Christ says come forth, the thing will come forth.
        He was like okay, loose him, let him go and people that were around, 
        you know those Jews that did not use to believe Jesus before
        it was at this time that they believed</strong></blockquote>
        <br>
	So, I was reading the other day and something really drew my 
        attention. It's the story about Lazarus. As I was reading 
        and the part that caught my attention was <b>'He abode still,
        two days in the same place where He was'</b> as the story will 
        continue, He said to His disciples, He said that (..ahh)
        'let us enter into Judea again' they said, 'they want to 
        kill you in that place'. He said that (...ahh), 'Lazarus is
         sleeping'. His disciples didn't really understand the 'sleeping' 
        They said (...ahh), 'if He is sleeping then that's good for
        him'. Jesus said, 'No, you don't understand it, He 
        has died'
        <br><br>
        However, there was something He said that was really interesting 
        which was 'this sickness is not unto death but its unto 
        the glory of God'. Like, there are somethings that will 
        happen that God will intentionally allow to happen. 
            <br><br>
        The other thing that hit me was Christ knew the whole time 
        that He was sick, Christ knew the whole time that He had died 
        because Christ said 'He is sleeping'. The same Martha that 
        came to meet Him and told Him before Lazarus died that Lazarus 
        was sick. That same Martha came out of her house and came to 
        meet Him before He even got home and was like 'If you had come,
         Lazarus wouldn't have died. <b>But I know that anything You 
         ask God, He will do'</b>.
        <br><br>
        I say 'Wow!!' Woman, your faith is major. She was grieving, 
        her brother had died and she told Christ before he died and 
        what she is saying is 'but I know that anything You ask of 
        God, He will do it'. ahhh.. As in, that woman's faith is 
        challenging. Wow!!
        <br><br> 
        Jesus Christ approached the house and Mary, Martha, people were 
        there and they were all crying. And then, the scripture says, Christ groaned
        in His Spirit. That helped me to understand, it wasn't that 
        Christ didn't love Lazarus, it wasn't scarcity of love that made 
        Him to stay two days, it wasn't lack of care that made Him to stay two days.
        This is because the scriptures says, Christ groaned. That means 
        when we weep, when we grieve, when we go through stuffs,
         Christ groans in His Spirit.
        <br><br>
        The part that now drove it all in, 'Jesus wept'.That is one of the only
         parts of the bible, thirty-three years that I saw that Jesus 
         Christ wept. haa. I now said, haa... 'Jesus Christ really loved 
         this man'.
            <br><br>
        They've tied Him up, they've put a stone over the grave and everything.
        Jesus Christ had to be like (say), 'Where did you put Him?'
         And then you know they went in and Jesus Christ said 'Take 
         away the stone'. Maybe it is time to take away the stone.
         All those things that you know, we may have done and we are like
          we think it is over because of what the reality looks like so we just 
         take actions in our mind to close that chapter. 
        <br><br>
          Maybe it is time to take away the stone. Maybe its time to take away the stone.
          Maybe Christ is about to come into Judea. Remember what He said at the
          beginning to His disciples, He said 'Let's go into Judea, Lazarus 
          has died'. 
          Like, <b>in their minds, they think it is over but it is not over, let's 
          go into Judea.</b>
        <br><br>
          So, maybe Christ is about to come into Judea and its like,
          we need to take away whatever stones we've put over the..., wherever 
          we've put the stone, whatever kind of stones we've put. Maybe
	its time to take them away. And Christ said “Lazarus, come forth”.
	Christ is like what is that situation in your life? I’m about to give it life.
	He was like “I am the resurrection and The Life” because He was still
	telling Martha that your brother will live again and Martha was like “Yes 
	Lord, I know, that in the resurrection, He will be resurrected” and 
	Jesus Christ is saying see this woman I, I myself is the resurrection 
	and The Life. And Jesus Christ said Lazarus come forth and that man
 	came out even with grave clothes on his face. <b>It didn’t even matter that 
	he was tied up, it didn’t matter that He had grave clothes on 
	his face, that man still came out, straight up because that situation 
	had received life.</b> 
        <br><br>
        It does not just even matter anything that has tied it down, 
        When Christ says come forth, the thing will come forth.
        He was like okay, loose him, let him go and people that were around, 
        you know those Jews that did not use to believe Jesus before
        it was at this time that they believed, many of them actually believed.
        That situation was used to show off the glory of God. So, Jesus could 
        have healed him before He died but if Jesus Christ had healed him before 
        He died, those Jews that believed him at this particular point, will they 
        have believed? These people knew and saw clearly that Lazarus died
        but they could also see with their eyes that he had been raised up. 
        <br><br>
       	 Imagine how far this news will go. Even for Mary and Martha, 
               Now their faith in Christ will be like next level. This kind of thing, 
               let’s say He was sick and Christ healed him. Maybe some people will say 
               ahh, He was going to be alright anyways. Is he not using drugs, did he heal 
               him? But this one, nobody can hide it, nobody can tell story ontop of it.
               Nothing nothing nothing. Even Christ said that it was good that He wasn’t
               There when Lazarus died because this would be for the glory of God. 
               Let’s say Christ was there maybe somebody will think of a possible manipulation
		If it was that he healed the sickness, maybe somebody will think Lazarus 
		could have been healed we know he is taking drugs.
                   <br><br>
               In this particular case because everyone knew that the guy had died 
               They had put grave clothes, they had put stones, everything
               has ended, matter has ended. Then Jesus Christ said Let 
		us go into Judea, something wants to happen there.
               <b>What’s that situation? Once Jesus Christ says “come forth”,
               Haa… the matter has ended; because its being delayed don’t 
               mean that God is not hearing, that Jesus is not hearing.
               That delay may just be so that your miracle can be like… 
               Everybody!… nobody will be able to deny it at the end of the day.
               It really… it wowed me.</b>
		<br><br>
		Because the situation looks like it is over doesn’t
               Really mean it is over, one. Two, <b>because He is not saying anything, 
               because there is a delay in answer, because the matter is red,
               because the situation looks like…(speechless) as in…(speechless) 
		it don’t mean that the answer won’t come.</b>
        	<br><br>
        	And, I am challenged by Martha’s faith, the fact that at the point  
        	even after Christ came, she still ran out to meet Him, she was still the one 
        	that went in and went to call Mary, she was still the one that
        	said Christ, I know that anything you ask God, He will do…
            	<br><br>
        	Yea, I hope this read has challenged you.
        	Till I write again,
        	If you did enjoy this blog, please share to someone.
        	<br><br>
        	Much love! Besos!!<br><br><br><br>
