        <br>
        Today, I’ll be sharing <b>therapies</b> that work for 
        <b>fitness, beauty</b> and some <b>for great taste</b>,
         just for the enjoyment of it.. 
        I love taking fruits a lot and at some point, I just wanted 
        more so I started to make it into smoothies and I’ve tried
        out so many different recipes.
        The ones I’ll be sharing are my top recipes. Basically, 
        I’ll be sharing exactly what ingredient are good for
         what exactly. . 
        <br><br>
        First, let me say that we all know all 
        fruits are nutritious. However, do all fruits have the same function,
        No. They have different effects. 
        This first recipe helps with <b>weight management</b> and I will 
        explain how when I’m talking about what exactly the individual 
        fruits do. 
        <br><br>
        <h6><strong>Smoothie Recipe for Weight Management</strong></h6> 
        In this recipe, I have apple, carrots, lemon, grapes, 
        cucumber, raspberries. I use soyamilk and yoghurt to
        blend because they are liquid and a good source of protein.
        Also, I use yoghurt for its flavour. 
        Previously, I used to add water 
        but I don’t do this anymore however, you can add water if you like.
        <br><br>
        The three major ingredients are lemon, apple and cucumber. 
        <b>Lemon</b> contains <b>D-Limonene</b> 
        which <b>decreases cholesterol levels</b>, 
        it prevents accumulation of <b>fat</b> and 
        <b>fat residues</b> , it also <b>reduces glucose levels</b>. 
        These three things in themselves 
        already helps reduce fat.
        Lemon is also good for something else, 
        it contains <b>antioxidants</b>  that helps to slow down the 
        aging process.
        <br><br>
        The next fruit is <b>Apple</b>. Apple is very effective in 
        <b>reducing cholesterol levels</b>  and one very good 
        part of apple is 
        that it has a<b>high mass</b> but with a 
        <b>low energy density</b>.  
        That is, from a whole apple, all you get is 75 calories 
        but it occupies very reasonable space in the stomach. 
        Like… sometimes when one is hungry, you can just nibble, 
        you can just chew on an apple and you have yourself feeling 
        a little bit full. That, you can’t get from an orange. 
        You drink one orange, No, you are not feeling full. 
        But an apple is bulky, 
        it is good for <b>appetite control</b>and it
        <b>slows down aging</b>.
        <br><br>
        The next one is cucumber. <b>Cucumber</b> is 95% water so, you 
        definitely want to add that to your smoothie because it 
        just provides liquid for the blending of your smoothie. 
        Adding to that, it occupies so much space and the 
        calories you get from cucumber is so low. It has you 
        feeling full and it has you very <b>hydrated</b>. It contains 
        vitamins A, K, and E.
        <br><br>
        Next, we have raspberries. 
        <b>Raspberries</b> help to prevent <b>obesity</b>. 
        It fights against <b>fatty liver disease</b>. 
        Raspberries contain <b>manganese</b> and manganese 
        helps to keep metabolic rate high, burning away fat.
        <br><br>
        The other ingredients in this recipe are carrot and 
        red grapes. I add them for the taste that they give to the smoothie. 
        I wil be talking about these ingredients in the next recipe. 
        In this next recipe, I use them for 
        skin care.
        <br><br>
        <h6><strong>Smoothie Recipe for Skin Care</strong></h6>
        For this recipe, I add carrots, red grapes, apples, soya 
        and yoghurt. Sometimes, I throw in strawberries. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Carrot</b> is rich in <b>Vitamin A</b> 
        and <b>Beta-carotene</b>. 
        <b>Vitamin A</b> protects the skin from <b>sun damage</b>. 
        Let me just add 
        this that the sunlight is good for like ten minuites. Yes, one 
        needs it for about 10 - 15 minuites a day but more than that, 
        its just damaging to the skin. Carrot contains Vitamin A and 
        Vitamin A helps to protect from <b>sun damage</b>. It also assists the 
        liver to <b>flush out toxins</b>. 
        <br><br>
        <b>ß-Carotene</b> found in carrots also 
        helps to slow down aging and it promotes an even skin tone. 
        It not only helps your skin tone to be even but it as well prevents having a
        dry skin. The next ingredient red grapes is what I call golden
        fruit. Like, to me, this is a golden fruit because its just 
        life for the skin.
        <br><br>
        <b>Red Grapes</b> contain resveratrol. <b>Resveratrol</b> is very effective
        in protecting the skin against harmful effects of sunlight. It 
        is antiaging and it even goes as far as reversing aging signs. 
        However, the key here is consistency. Apple, I use more for 
        fitness. In this recipe, I add it for taste 
        and it helps that it slows down aging so yeah, that’s good for 
        the skin.
        <br><br>
        <b>Strawberry</b> in this recipe helps to 
        <b>reduce bloating</b> because it 
        counteracts gas so, yeah you want that… like the <b>trimmer stomach</b>, 
        yes you should take strawberries and yea it doesn’t hurt that they 
        give a very great flavor. Nevermind that strawberries are a 
        little bit <b>sour</b>. When you blend them with the smoothie, somewhere 
        in the smoothie the sour taste is lost and all you have is the 
        good nice taste of strawberry and the flavor.
        <br><br>
        The last recipe I will be talking about is the recipe three and 
        this one is just great, it has, it gives a very great taste.
        <br><br>
        <h6><strong>Smoothie Recipe for Great Taste</strong></h6> 
        In this one, I add banana, strawberries, apples, carrots, 
        soya and yoghurt. I won’t be talking much about it because 
        already I talked about what strawberries are for, what 
        carrots do for us. The only new fruit here is banana. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Banana</b> in this recipe, I use it as the base, like… 
        as the bulk of the smoothie and banana just tastes nice 
        when you have it in a smoothie. Having strawberries, 
        carrots and apples in a smoothie; First, you have a very 
        nice color. Secondly, the taste is oh! my! God!. Then you 
        put in soya milk and you put in yoghurt. Please, not greek 
        yoghurt, the one without sweetening. No, I mean sweetened 
        yoghurt. 
        <br><br>
        Yoghurt is a good source of <b>probiotics</b>, soya is a 
        good source of protein, and you know how soya is an 
        <b>anti-carcinogen</b> that is, it prevents cancer, reduces the risk 
        of coming down with a cancer. So, this recipe givess a great taste,
        and is highly nutritious. You know, all fruits are actually nutritious
        so, regardless of the fruits you throw in, you are getting 
        nutrients.
        <br><br>
        These here are my three recipes. The first one I use for weight, 
        the second one I use for skin and the last one I use because it 
        has a really great taste. 
        <br>
