        <blockquote><strong>“Someone who is down in the ditch can’t pull Himself up. 
        He  needs someone who is up there to actually raise him. It takes a heart 
        of love to do that.”</strong></blockquote>
        <blockquote><strong>“Depression is in our midst, we can’t shy away from that. 
        There are a lot of people around us that are depressed. There are a lot of 
        things all around 
        happening that can lead to depression so we should understand that.”</strong></blockquote>
        A couple weeks back, I was on Instagram and there was this boy that 
        Had committed suicide. 
        Before He died, He left a suicide video. What struck me most of 
        everything He said was; 
        He said He had nothing to live for and it had been an ongoing issue, 
        He had tried to commit suicide previously and on this occasion, 
        He thought: "what was the point of living, what was the purpose of living? 
        He had really gotten to the end of it like… there was really nothing 
        to live for anymore". 
        <br><br>
        This was a guy who had a business and seemed to be doing well. 
        Still, he said he had nothing to live for. 
        Many people would say that they desire his life but for him, 
        in his eyes, he had nothing to live for. 
        <br>
        That made me feel like depression is not a matter of one’s 
        situation but how one perceives the situation.
        <br><br>
        Previously. I had also suffered from depression, <b>in my case, it 
        snuck up on me, 
        didn't realise what was happening to me until suicidal thoughts 
        were so regular like drinking water.</b> 
        At random moments, for example when walking on the road.
        <br><br>
        Speaking with two doctors, I learnt that
        <b>Common Indicators Of Depression</b> are; <br>
        Loss of interest in things one previously had interest 
        in;<br>
        Feeling hopeless;<br>
        Constant moodiness;<br>
        Constant tiredness;<br>
        Inability to sleep;<br>
        Weight loss or weight gain;<br>
        Lack of appetite;<br>
        Having suicidal thoughts.
        <br><br>
        It was very eye-opening for me that weight loss or weight gain made 
        it to that list because… generally, 
        when one sees a person gaining weight, one tends to think, they are 
        enjoying themselves, 
        they are living life… meanwhile, it may be an issue of someone 
        being depressed.
        So maybe, one may not necessarily need to assume. 
        Maybe sometimes, check on them. If it is a case of weight loss, 
        maybe also, check on them.
        <br><br>
        One of the doctors added: "It’s very good that we don’t just jump 
        into conclusion anytime we make 
        comments to people or about people. About the way they look, about 
        their health. 
        Sometimes, our comments may actually worsen a depressive state. 
        We need to be more sensitive when passing comments". 
        <br><br>
        In the conversation one of the doctors highlighted <br>
        <strong>Wrong Ways That Persons Resort To, 
        In A Bid To Cope With Depression</strong>
        Dissociating oneself from people who can help one <br>
        Picking up habits like smoking, drinking, drugs <br>
        Engaging in sexual activities <br>
        Withdrawing from society with the believe that one can deal 
        with depression personally
        <br><br>
        <h6><strong>Our Position as Christians</strong></h6> 
        Stand from God’s point of view <br>
        Having high or low moments may occur but not to allow oneself be 
        overwhelmed by activities that occur around us <br>
        Not to carry one’s burden alone. Allow Jesus, The Holyspirit who is 
        our comforter to help one.
        <br><br>
        We remember Elijah who wanted his life to be taken away, Job also similarly. 
        <b>However, we can remember that in Elijah’s case, God had people whom He 
        had prepared to support in the ministry. 
        Elijah wasn’t actually alone as he was feeling.</b> We must allow 
        The Holyspirit to work in us.
        We may be downcast but never allow ourselves be in a state of 
        consistent depression. 
        <b>We should always as Christians remember that we have a place of 
        advantage which is God, God is the ultimate. 
        As long as we have God, we have everything.</b>
        <br><br>
        <h6><strong>When Depressed, How Do We Come Out Of It.</strong></h6>
        The Doctors advised,
        When in a situation which one can’t handle, the first point of call is God, 
        One who can handle the situation. 
        A popular saying goes <blockquote>“What is good requires prayer, 
            what is bad also needs prayer”.</blockquote>  
        Prayer is relevant in the short and long term
        Also, to talk about it in the short term and avoid bottling up things. <br> 
        It helps to relieve one of the burden and make one feel better <br>
        Avoid staying alone, meet with people, talk with people, 
        don’t isolate oneself,<br> 
        Pray often, talk to God more, 
        believing that He can hear one’s prayer. <br>
        Have a network of good people around one. <br>
        Avoid staying with toxic or other depressed people <br>
        In the long run, see a therapist if all other efforts don’t work
        <br><br>
        In addition, our first line of defence really is to look up to God.
        Let the Word of God be one’s friend
        That is when to hold on to God’s promises
        Remember the good things God has done in the past, look back to one’s testimony, one’s victories. 
        The problems may seem overwhelming but look back to testimonies
        <br>
        <strong>As A Community,</strong>
         What’s our response when we observe a person showing signs of depression?<br>
        Relate with them, mix with them,get close to the person, 
        understand, with a friendly approach, 
        be sincere about it, willing to help.<br> 
        Ask pertinent questions, heart-to-heart questions that makes 
        the person feel cared for<br>
        We may advance into helping the person.<br> 
        Most importantly, get close to them, try to know what they are going 
        through, speak with them, 
        try to bring them out of the bottled up situation, 
        let them express themselves and that way we may be able to help.
        <br><br>
        <b>Something what is key is, to have love in one’s heart, 
        not be too focused on ourselves and our business 
        but give people some of our attention. Let them know that they matter. 
        Not with words but with actions</b>.<br>
        As friends, teachers, Pastors, spouses, let them know they are worth 
        our time.<br>
        Avoid stigmatization. This is not a time to condemn actions. 
        It is a time to give words of hope, positive vibes.<br>
        <blockquote><strong>“Someone who is down in the ditch can’t even pull Himself up. 
        He  needs someone who is up there to actually
        raise him. It takes a heart of love to do that.”</strong></blockquote> 
        Also, keep them in mind. When you cannot help, you may know someone that could help. 
        Ideas might come up while in conversation with other people.<br>
        Be sensitive, in a bid to help, not to share information of a person with 
        another one who will not handle
        the situation in a sensitive manner.<br>
        Try to be careful with one’s speech so as not to worsen a situation
        <br><br>
        Lastly, when we can, create a community that helps those who are depressed. 
        To help people come out of depression and lead a better life
        <br><br>
        <h5><strong>Last Words</strong></h5>
        <strong>Depression is in our midst, we can’t shy away from that. 
        There are a lot of people around us that are depressed. 
        There are a lot of things all around happening that can lead to 
        depression so we should understand that.</strong>
        Also, understand that as Christians, we don’t have to bear burdens alone. 
        <b>There are lots of promises in the 
        bible that solves all our problems.
        For example, regarding economy, The Bible says that God will supply 
        our needs according to His riches in 
        glory by Christ Jesus. 
        This makes our economy heaven based not earth based.</b>
        Understand that what is happening to one is not the worst thing 
        that can happen to a person and with God, 
        one can go through anything.
        <br><br>
        <b>“If you are depressed, remember that your breath is a gift of life. 
        It may not feel that way but it is.</b> 
        Also, lives depend on you, some lives have been assigned to you to be 
        elevated through you. 
        Seek ways to get out quickly from the downcast mode.
        What gets you in an elevated mood? Is it Music, listen. Whatever 
        it is, do it 
        (provided that it is legal and good, hopefully not drugs).
        Talk to as many people as you can about it. Try to find a solution.
        <b>Depression tries to take the energy away from you but the faster 
        you find a solution to the problem, 
        the faster you come out of depression.</b>
        <br><br>
        Try to have hope you know, smile, relate with people, talk with people, 
        organize parties, 
        spend time with other people.
        Do what you love. Whatsoever thing you love and are interested in. 
        Once you start doing what you love and are interested in, 
        depression will not find a place within because your heart is already 
        taken by what you love”
