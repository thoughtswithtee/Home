        <br>
        I had this conversation with a very fashionable and modest 
        Christian lady, we talked about everything from men’s fashion 
        to trends, to fashion events and women’s fashion.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> What influences your style?
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> Growing up as a child, I grew up with a very 
        fashionable mum. She is a very fashionable sweet lady. During 
        my teenage age, I usually hear this saying that “your mum is 
        more fashionable than you girls”. I have a sister, an elder 
        sister. I always thought, what makes her more fashionable 
        than me? but I usually see the way she combines her colours, 
        the way she combines her dress, and she doesn’t just wear 
        anything. Even if it’s not very expensive, she makes sure 
        that she looks good at every point in time. 
        That was one of the biggest influence and second one is
        <br><br>
        As a child of God, whatever we wear should give God glory. 
        <b>I try my best to make 
        sure that I look good and what I am wearing gives God glory.</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Do christian leaders, celebrities or even 
        regular people influence your fashion style, do you ever 
        look to people and sometimes, their fashion style influences 
        yours?
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> Yea, somehow, I wont say they do. If I see 
        something I like that is very beautiful, I appreciate it. 
        That does not necessarily mean I am picking that thing. It 
        could be an influence to some part of my creativity in terms 
        of dressing 
        but not necessarily “this person did this, I want to do it”.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b>Are there any specific 
        <b>underlying principles that guide your choices of clothing 
            items, fashion items
        </b> whether consciously or unconsciously. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b>It still boils down to modesty, being moderate 
        and comfortable, its that for me.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> For me, comfortability goes to the next level 
        like, <b>I want to be physically comfortable and also I want to 
        be comfortable in my mind.</b> Not just that the attire, I am 
        comfortable in it physically but also in my mind, 
        I am also comfortable looking that way. 
        <br><br>
        For me also, I feel like <b>looking good is a virtue</b> 
        because by the time you put some effort into doing all of this, 
        it shows that you do care, it shows effort and then, I feel 
        like putting in that effort into looking good is a virtue.
        <br><br>
        Something else, I was reading the scripture recently and 
        something struck me, Christ was taking about giving and then, 
        treasures in heaven and He said provide for yourselves, 
        (that is, buy for yourselves) bags that don’t wear out, that is, things that don’t get old, that don’t get bad easily. And, I’m like He is talking about giving to the poor and all these things and the next thing He says is provide for yourself, bags that don’t wear out. That means He wants us to get quality items, durable items. That means if you want to get this blouse, don’t go and buy the cheap one, buy that 
        expensive one (durable one) because it will last you for a 
        long time. 
        <br><br>
        (Although, this scripture gives us a picture of how Jesus 
        expects that we make purchases, this scripture was not 
        referring to bags or clothes in the context Jesus uses it 
        but was using an earthly picture to illustrate and bring
         understanding to something spiritual and of eternal value)
        <br><br>
        As I read that, I decided that I have to incorporate that 
        into my lifestyle.
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> Funny enough, that’s the kind of mum I have, 
        she doesn’t just buy things because she wants to buy it. 
        I can go to my mum’s house now and see a bag that she bought 
        ten years ago and 
        she confidently uses its today because its quality and still 
        good.
        <br><br>
        Some of us will not have the money to buy that very 
        quality thing but whenever you are buying something 
        and you know 
        you can afford it, <b>because of the durability, just go for it.</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> I feel like what Christ was trying to say was 
        instead of buying five jeans that will get spoilt by next year, 
        buy two that you can use for the next ten years.
        <br><br>
        So, there is also this popular saying, dress for the occasion. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Do you dress for the occasion?</b>
        <b>Guest:</b> Ahhh… <b>never to be caught ‘unfresh’.</b> 
        You do not know where you will find yourself at that time that 
        you will need to be very presentable to be in that particular place. 
        So, I think for any occasion, 
        for stepping out of your house, just be presentable.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> In the same vein of dressing for the occasion, 
        there are some occasions that the “socially acceptable” or 
        popular way of dressing there… For example, if you are going 
        to the beach, would you dress for the occasion of going to the beach.
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> Talking about the beach, for me, as a believer and 
        as a Christian, I do not fancy wearing bikini out there revealing 
        my body for the world. There are things you can also wear to the 
        beach that will make you very comfortable and you will still enjoy 
        the moment. 
        For me, I cannot go to the beach and be on just a bikini.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> This reminds me, I forgot to mention. Something 
        that guides my dressing is, does this particular dress I want to buy 
        or what I want to wear right now, <b>does it cover my nakedness? 
        Going to the beach is still public and my nakedness is still 
        my nakedness whether it is the beach or not.</b>
        <br><br>
        You know, there are quite some interesting outfits that 
        you enter the gym and you’re like ohhhh!! Would you wear an 
        “Uh-huhhhhh!” dress to the gym or you are still on the plane 
        of cover your nakedness?
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> For the gym, you know one thing about this life, 
        <b>there is always something that is very moderate and something 
        that is very extreme.</b> In going to the gym as a believer, as 
        a Christian, you know, the bible says, do not cause a man to sin 
        or lust because of your appearance and you know that there is 
        something alternative to what you want to wear that you will wear 
        and you are not revealing and you will still do your exercise and 
        you will still keep fit, loose your weight. You know, sometimes 
        even if you cover the whole body, if a man wants to look at you 
        lustfully, they will still look 
        at you lustfully but you as a person, have you played your part?
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> So, the whole thing I just hear from you is going 
        to the gym 
        or going to the beach is not an excuse to reveal your nakedness. 
        <br><br>
        What do you consider as nakedness?
        <br><br>
        Guys, I am not coming for you but sometimes, 
        its now becoming popular that guys would you know, 
        they won’t wear underwear, they will wear a shirt and open 
        like three buttons and just leave it like that then you know 
        just put a really nice neck piece. Its actually quite very 
        fashionable but I don’t know what’s motivating it.
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> To look (makes imaginary hand quote in the air) hot.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Like they won’t wear underwear.
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> Especially white shirt.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> You see, the image I had in my head was a white shirt.
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> Well starched shirt, you’ll now see the cross necklace. They’ll even wear cross and be showing it.
        <br><br>
        (both laugh)
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> I don’t know the motivation. Guys that are out there, 
        please tell us your motivation. Why do you do that?
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> Just the same way we ladies will try to dress and not 
        make you guys lust after our dressing, same way guys should 
        dress and not make the ladies look and like… wow! that’s a chest
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> I think you heard her.
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b>Just imagine, Jesus was a girl. The bible says that we 
        are created in the image and likeness of God. So, whatsoever you are 
        wearing, you are dressing in the sense that “I am god”, because you 
        are. <b>If you are a god, will you just wear anything?,</b> will you 
        just 
        reveal your nakedness? Will you just reveal those cleavages there? 
        Will Jesus be comfortable with His cleavage going up and down on 
        the street? Or will he be okay with His butt revealing there on the 
        street? People have preferences but outside our preferences, let’s 
        just think, will Jesus do this, will He be comfortable in this? Will 
        Jesus be on a bumshort and go and meet somebody and tell the person 
        “Jesus actually loves you” and at the end would the person give 
        their lives to God or draw closer to God?
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> If you had a front row seat to Newyork fashion 
        week, would you attend?
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest: </b>There’s a lot of creativity there that you would see 
        and like. For me, when I see something good, I always appreciate it. 
        If I have the opportunity to be in the new york fashion week, I’ll go.
         I’ll watch the creativity, watch how things are being done. 
         In life, <b>you have the opportunity to sieve what comes in you and 
         stays within you</b> so, if you go there and there are things that 
         don’t really fit into your fashion sense because you know as a 
         believer you are not supposed to dress like this, that’s not what 
         you should pick.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> <b>Fashion is fashion, you as a person, 
        you now determine how you project that fashion.</b>
        <br><br>
        What final words do you have for us today?
        <br><br>
        <b>final words?</b>
        <b>Guest:</b> Be moderate, be comfortable with what you wear and 
        just see yourself that whatsoever you are wearing, 
        does it give God glory? For me, that’s enough to dress right.
        
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> My final words would be  
        that we need to be intentional about what we do, one and two, 
        <br><br>
        Trends go all around, there are always fashion trends, one fashion 
        trend comes another fashion trend goes. 
        <b>I think the question we 
            need to ask ourselves is, (especially also in 
            reference to attending fashion events like the Newyork fashionweek) 
            what is inspiring this fashion trend,
        </b> does it please God? 
        <br>
        Finally on trends, when this fashion trend is out of style, 
        what’s going to happen to 
        that cloth that we have bought? So, I feel like as Christians we 
        should be aware not to follow the world and its fashion and 
        trends but we should have our own unique style, our own unique 
        dress sense that pleases God and at any time, 
        at any season, we can still go with this flow.
        <br><br>
        I hope you found this insightful.
        Please share with someone that needs to read it.
        <br><br>
        Much love! Besos!!<br><br><br><br>
