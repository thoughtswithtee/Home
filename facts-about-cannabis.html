        <blockquote><strong>“Conversations are ongoing in public 
            offices, pushing for cannabis legislation. 
            This makes Cannabis of national interest. This 
            then raises the question and makes one ask, 
            Why are are these conversations ongoing?
            If its not medically considered comfortably safe, 
            why are there conversations to make it legal for 
            recreational use that is, for persons to 
            use it simply for fun.”</strong></blockquote>
        <strong>“Something being natural doesn’t make 
            it safe for consumption.”</strong>
        <br>
        Recently, 12 days back, the 4.20PM Cannabis culture day was observed. 
        This was the 20th of April. A while back, I happened on that day to be with a 
        few people that were celebrating this culture. One of them 
        wanted to have a conversation with me about it but I really 
        couldn’t partake because I realised that most of what I knew 
        about cannabis was hearsay, nothing solid. Not to mention 
        that I had been secondarily exposed to it for at least five 
        years now. 
        <br><br>
        This made me choose to research on it. Today, 
        I will be writing about Cannabis.
        The effects of Cannabis;
        Medical uses of Cannabis;
        Legality of Cannabis; Countries in which it is legal; 
        In what form it is legal. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Cannabis is a psychoactive drug,</b> it has two major components 
        that are responsible for most of its effects.
        First, THC which is Tetrahydrocannabinol while
        The second component that is interesting for Cannabis is CBD, 
        Cannabidiol
        <br><br>
        <strong>CBD</strong>
        <b>While THC is the psychoactive component, CBD is 
        the non-psychoactive component</b> of cannabis. They both have several medical uses. 
        CBD, Cannabidiol has been approved by the FDA in some states within the Unites States
        In Canada, it is approved in some drug form 
        In a few other countries, it is approved for medical use. Medical uses include
        Its potential in the treatment of Epilepsy
        Improves appetite for HIV/AIDS patients
        Antiemetic, in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy
        Treatment of neuropathic pain
        Treatment of rheumatoid Arthritis
        <br><br>
        <strong>THC</strong>
        THC on the other hand is the psychoactive 
        component(Schizophrenia, Hallucinations, Psychosis) 
        and it has not been approved for use in majority of countries. 
        There are several risks in using it.
        These risks include
        Addiction/Dependence
        Withdrawal Syndrome
        Lowering of IQ
        Reduction in brain density of neural fibers - evidence from brain scans
        <br>
        However, there is a drug, that has a combination of 
        CBD and THC, it is approved for use in some countries
        <br><br>
        Politicians, activists, legislators are pushing for 
        cannabis legislation. This makes Cannabis of national 
        interest as people occupying certain public positions 
        or having influence are trying to make it legal. 
        This then raises the question and makes one ask, 
        Why are persons trying to make it legal?
        If its not medically approved, why are persons trying 
        to make it legal for recreational use, for persons to 
        just use it simply to have fun.
        <br><br>
        <h6><strong> Misconceptions Associated With The Use of Cannabis</strong></h6> 
        Lets discuss the misconceptions that are associated with the use of cannabis
        Misconception - It is non-addictive-No, it is addictive.It is addictive 
        with withdrawal syndrome
        <br><br>
        Misconception - It improves lung activity-No, it does not improve lung activity. 
        Possibly, this misconception arises from the medical fact that the
         use of cannabis causes widening of the bronchioles and because of 
         this, maybe people think it improves the activity/functioning of the lung. 
         Actually, in the long term what happens is that it reportedly is 
         involved with chronic bronchitis.
         <br><br>
        Misconception - It is possible to smoke only 
        cannabis-there are extreme circumstances where 
        persons with very high discipline smoke only cannabis but investigative 
        facts indicates that many persons that use cannabis started from using
         tobacco or other illicit drugs and then graduated into using cannabis. 
         <br><br>
         In other cases, persons that started using cannabis went ahead to use tobacco. 
         Many Cannabis users mix cigarette and cannabis together. 
         Other cannabis users went ahead to use even more damaging drugs. 
        <b>Cannabis is reportedly a gateway drug.</b>  Previously persons started 
         with tobacco and went on to use cannabis. However, now, cannabis serves 
         as a gateway to tobacco and other illicit drugs so, its a case of a 
        <b>reverse gateway drug situation.</b>
         <br><br>
        Last misconception is that - it is of natural origin and that makes it safe... 
        Who are we playing with? There are so many things which
         are of natural origin but are not safe.
        Ever heard of poisonous mushrooms?-Mushrooms that are entirely
         natural and one takes a bite then is dead? 
         <br><br>
         Shellfishes poisoned 
         with algae and once eaten, one is paralysed. Shell fishes are of 
         natural origin, algae are of natural origin. Several plants are of 
         natural origin, not to mention cocaine being of natural origin, 
          from the leaf of the coca plant(In only 2013, cocaine was responsible 
          for 4300 deaths).
        <b> -Something being natural doesn’t make it safe for consumption.</b> 
        <br><br>
        <strong>Why Persons Seek Out To Use Cannabis Recreationally.</strong>
        For the europhoric effect it gives-
        A possible alternative would be watching comedic movies(jokes..worth a try though) <br>
        For its relaxing effect, the CBD component of cannabis 
        gives a relaxing effect-possible alternative, 
        read an entertaining book (jokes too.. surely worth the try still though) <br>
        It gives an energy boost-eat, take a smoothie, a shake, drink water-good 
        energy right there. <br>
        For creativity, inspiration or motivation-find what 
        you love(…I’m just playing with you)
        <br><br>
        <h6><strong> In what countries is cannabis legalised?</strong></h6>,
        Within Europe, it is legalised in one form or another and generally for 
        medical use
        In Canada, legalised for Medical use
        In most African countries, No it is not legalised for any kind of use. 
        Ghana is an exception, a pharmaceutically purified form is legalised for 
        medical use. In South Africa, it is legalised both for medical and 
        recreational use;
        In China, not legalised;
        In Thailand, it is legalised in one form or the other.
        In Australia, for medical use
        <br><br>
        <h6><strong> Effects Of Cannabis</strong></h6>
        <strong>Short Term Effects of Cannabis.</strong>
        Immediately after smoking, there is intoxication, 
        it affects behaviour, people might see things differently, 
        they might loose consciousness, they might behave differently. 
        Some persons might just be really excited. Some persons  
        might think differently, they might see small things as big. 
        <br><br>
        It basically influences the mind immediately, it intoxicates.
        Some persons might have panic attacks. Mostly, 
        this is for first time users. Some persons might hallucinate 
        from first time usage but not only from first time usage. 
        Some persons also hallucinate after regular usage, perhaps when they take a higher dose.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Long term Effects of Cannabis</strong>
        Some persons get addicted, they depend on it.
        <br>
        Some persons unfortunately develop a stroke from it.
        <br>
        It leads to acute bronchitis.
        <br>
        It influences the brain development, changes the brain structure 
        after long term usage
        <br>
        It reduces the density of neural fibers in some parts of the brain, 
        it lowers the IQ
        <br>
        It is associated with lower educational outcome, people achieve less 
        educationally
        <br>
        Lower life satisfaction
        <br>
        It increases the risk of using other illicit drugs
        <br>
        It impairs the memory, it impairs cognition
        <br>
        It influences people’s ability to learn.
        <br><br>
        There is a 9% chance of addiction when one uses cannabis. 
        One may say that this chance is low but the chance of dying 
        from corona virus is from below 1% to about 5%... It’s really 
        low. However, as at 2020, after less than a year of the 
        pandemic, the deaths recorded was already above 300,000. 
        This is only to say that the chances of something 
        happening being low does not mean it doesn't happen. A person may 
        not get addicted but why risk finding out. 
        Why take the risk of disrupting one's life if one 
        develops an addiction later on.
        <br><br>
        Also, the idea of dependence on drugs to do basic things
        isn’t very cute. If it is a medical situation and it is 
        prescribed, that could work.
        One might argue that alcohol and tobacco are more 
        harmful than cannabis but are legal for recreational use. 
        In this case, it might be worthwhile to consider the argument
        that drunk driving is the top second factor
        in the whole world that’s responsible for road accidents.
        Tobacco is ranked by WHO as the one cause of death 
        in the whole world that could be prevented. The 
        question here is if Tobacco was illegal, 
        would it still have this status?
        The problem with alcohol and tobacco having these 
        status can then be loosely associated with:
        <br>
        1. They are accepted
        <br>
        2. They are available
        <br>
        3. They are considered as cool and
        <br>
        4. Their legal status
        <br><br>
        Combining the fact that they are addictive to the above 
        these opens a door to abuse. On one hand its damaging, 
        on the other hand, its societally accepted, its legal, its okay to do.
        <br><br>
        However, the damaging reports from alcohol and tobacco use brings to
         light that the legal status of a substance may not necessarily be a 
         true reflection of the safety status of that substance.
