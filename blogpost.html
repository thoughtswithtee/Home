        		In the first, Jesus and His disciples started a boat trip. 
			From the start of the trip, Jesus was in the boat, on the way, 
			a tempest arose with Jesus still in the boat. However, 
			Jesus seemed unbothered as He was recorded to have been 
			fast asleep on a pillow. The disciples were in a total panic,

                        A couple weeks back, I was on Instagram and there was this boy that Had committed suicide. 
                        Before He died, He left a suicide video. What struck me most of everything He said was; 
                        He said He had nothing to live for and it had been an ongoing issue, 
                        He had tried to commit suicide previously and on this occasion, 
                        He thought: "what was the point of living, what was the purpose of living? 
                        He had really gotten to the end of it like…
