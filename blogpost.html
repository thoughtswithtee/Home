        		In the first, Jesus and His disciples started a boat trip. 
			From the start of the trip, Jesus was in the boat, on the way,

                        just for the enjoyment of it.. 
                        I love taking fruits a lot and at some point, I just wanted 
                        more so I started to make it into smoothies and I’ve tried
                        out so many different recipes.
                        The ones I’ll be sharing are my top recipes. Basically, 
                        I’ll be sharing exactly what ingredient are good for
                        what exactly. .

                        A couple weeks back, I was on Instagram and there was this boy that Had committed suicide. 
                        Before He died, He left a suicide video. What struck me most of everything He said was; 
                        He said He had nothing to live for and it had been an ongoing issue, 
                        He had tried to commit suicide previously and on this occasion, 
                        He thought: "what was the point of living, what was the purpose of living? 
                        He had really gotten to the end of it like…
