             after Jesus ascended to heaven”
                <br>
            He was the one that was used by God. Haaa…. hmmm… </strong></blockquote>
        <br>
        So, you know how its popular that when people are toxic 
        in your life, you get to cut 
        them off… like you cannot continue to maintain toxicity 
        or maintain a relationship with people that are negative 
        or people that pull you 
        down and I will say that I was really a "practicer" of these 
        things. Not just because of what I hear but also my experiences.
            <br><br>
        My experiences taught me not to accommodate toxicity. 
        My experiences taught me that when you give people 
        room after they have been toxic to you, they will be 
        toxic to you again. Recently, I had an experience that 
        has changed something in me.
            <br><br>
        I was just sitting and this scripture just replayed 
        itself in my mind and I had to search it out and read it. 
        So, Christ was talking to Peter and He said, “Feed my lamb”. 
        And, I’ve know this story, for a long time. 
        Jesus Christ asked Peter, three times. 
        Jesus Christ helped them and they 
        had food and Jesus Christ was asking Peter, “Do you love me 
        more than this? (the food)” and then 
        He said “Yes” and Christ told him, feed my lamb. 
        <br><br>
        And the next thing that dropped in my spirit was 
        “Do you realize that this same Peter that Jesus 
        was asking to feed His lamb, He denied Jesus three times?”
        “Do you realize that before He denied Jesus Christ three 
        times, Jesus Christ knew and Jesus Christ warned Him?”
        And this same man that Jesus Christ warned, when Jesus 
        Christ was warning that ‘you people will stumble because 
        of me’ nobody talked. It was Peter that came and said 
        ‘No, If anybody will, I will not, I can die for you’ 
        And everybody followed him and also spoke. 
        <br><br> 
        Everybody 
        was gentle, they wanted to come and catch Jesus, 
        He (Peter) brought out sword, gba!, cut someone’s ear, gba!. 
        Ahn ahn, Jesus Christ said ‘calm down’, Jesus put the 
        person’s ear back. All the mouth, all the action… but
        when it became real, when it mattered, when Jesus Christ 
        was being crucified, when there was no one supporting, 
        when it counted for someone to speak up for Him and say 
        ‘I know This Man, No. That’s not who He is.’ when it counted, 
        they asked, they said ‘ahh, you are one of His disciples, 
        we saw you with Him’ Peter said ‘e-eeyy, I don’t know 
        This Man’ They asked, another set of people came. 
        He said ‘I said I don’t this person’. 
        <br><br>
        And it dropped in my spirit that “This same man that 
        Jesus was saying ‘Feed my sheep’, He is the same one
         that denied Christ. He is the same one that was warned. 
         He is still the same one that Christ told ‘on this rock’, 
         He said ‘Peter, you are the rock, on this rock, I build 
         my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against 
         it’ And He is still the same one that was used by God 
         after Jesus ascended to heaven”
            <br><br>
        Peter was the one that was used by God... Haaa…. hmmm… 
        Then, I was thinking. Maybe sometimes, its more than
        a person's actions. Maybe sometimes its their heart.
        Maybe sometimes, its you knowing them, understanding them,
         knowing who they have been to you over time. 
         Having a bit of insight into their heart towards you and in that
         moment of understanding, try love, 
        try forgiveness, try looking beyond 
        the mistakes. 
        <br><br>
        Maybe in that moment of understanding try looking 
        at the good they are and have been. Maybe in that moment of discernment, 
        try not judging somebody from that one mistake. Maybe take a pause
        to remember the good that they have truly and sincerely 
        being to you.
        <br><br>
        Maybe, give it a second thought. In some cases, 
        that person has been designed to feed your lamb 
        in your absence. In some cases that person that has been 
        designed to take care of your business diligently, 
        faithfully in your absence is the same person that 
        would do something that terribly hurts you. Jesus Christ acted 
        differently. No wonder He said the greatest commandment is love. 
            <br><br>
        Love was the first thing. And then, that day I asked, 
        the ability to see beyond people’s flaws and despite 
        their flaws still see the good in them first. Jesus 
        was being killed, He was being crucified innocently and 
        there was no one to stand for Him and Peter denied Him 
        clear clear. Not once but three times despite the fact 
        that He was warned. And Jesus Christ was not just friends 
        with him. Jesus Christ "depended", I’ll use the word "depended" 
        on him. He said “Upon this rock I build my church”, He said 
        “Peter, feed my sheep” Ahh, that thing burst my brain. 
        <br><br>
        In our generation, so many of turn our backs on 
               people very quickly, many of us are taking out toxic 
               people from our lives very quickly and some of these toxic 
               people have being good people to us but in one moment 
               of making a mistake, in one moment of selfishness, 
               in one moment of carelessness, 
               they did something that was so… that broke us badly that 
               when we came out of that brokenness, we completely cut them off.
                   <br><br>
               I’m not saying keep toxic people in your life. Toxic people will be toxic. 
               What I’m saying is, good people make mistakes. So, have you
               tried understanding first, have you 
               tried love first, have you considered, ‘who were they 
               before this mistake’? Have you considered, ‘If I take 
               this out, what’s left of my relationship with them? 
               Is it still something to hold’? If you take out that 
               hurt, your relationship with them, is it worth 
               keeping? In some situations, you may have to give some 
               distance, you may have to give some space and in some 
               situations some person’s may need to be given a lot of 
                space.
        <br><br>
        However, it could be a good person, that made a genuine mistake, it 
        sometimes is an error in character 
        on their part, this one time. If all the other 
        things joined together still makes for good. Will we
         be blinded by this one mistake that we cannot see 
         past it and look to the other good that’s in this person. 
            <br><br>
        I’d say what I learned from it is that I put love first. 
        That in my dealings with people, when people wrong me, 
        that I would try to put understanding first, that I would 
        try to put consideration first, I’d try to see past the flaws 
        and see into the good regardless.
            <br><br>
        You know, Jesus Christ didn’t ask him once, 
        Jesus Christ asked him three times and from that, 
        I see that Jesus Christ was not being careless with him. 
        What I take from that is I’m not supposed to still be 
        careless with people and refuse to learn from what they do, 
        I should still be careful but even in that carefulness, 
        be open to receive love.
        <br><br>
        Another thing Christ said when he was warning Peter, 
        He said, the enemy has desired to sift you as wheat. 
        Christ said, I have prayed for you. 
        Ahh… as it was dropping in 
        my spirit, I was so challenged, I was just thinking of 
        myself, and I’m like… In that moment when I know this 
        guy will betray me, will I pray for him? 
            <br><br>
        Will I be able to think past the betrayal and say 
        its not you, the enemy has decided to sift you as 
        wheat but I have prayed for you. Will I still be 
        able to pray for him in that situation. That was love, 
        that was love, that was leading with love. He knew that 
        guy will deny him but he didn’t allow that to blind him, 
        He didn’t allow that to prevent him from loving him still. 
        Instead He said I have prayed for you.
        <br><br>
        Now. I am talking to Christians, as christians, do we pray 
        for each other?. When you see someone acting the way they 
        shouldn’t be acting with you, do you judge them first or 
        you pray for them first. Do you love them first or you 
        judge them? Do you act in love with them? Do you even 
        try to understand them?  Do you try to see beyond that act? 
        I really learnt from this and I hope that someone reading This
        does so too.
            <br><br>
        Yes, learn from what you have gone through with them but before you 
        think to cut them off, try understanding, try discernment first. 
        I hope this has helped you, 
        I hope it has spoken to you. It has spoken to me.
        The fact that He had twelve disciples and add to it the other seventy 
        he sent out but its this same Peter that had the call to “Feed my lamb”… hmmm, 
        It was profound.
