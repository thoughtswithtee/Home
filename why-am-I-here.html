        <blockquote><strong>“what are you dreaming about?. It’s not so much about 
            wild dreams, having imaginations, just dreaming here and there. 
            <br>
            I believe that this whole world, human race, 
            we are all little pieces in a large puzzle, we all have a 
            reason why we are here, we all have that little piece that 
            we have to add to the puzzle to make it all work out. We are 
            all moving to a destination and we all have a part to play.
            <br> Its understanding your purpose, having direction about your purpose, 
            understanding what drives you, what makes you tick, what do you 
            do and you are motivated all by yourself, you don’t need external 
            motivation. You start doing it and you don’t stop.”</strong></blockquote>
        <br>
        <b>Host:</b> Do you think if a person dreams really big far 
        beyond where they are, it can come true… because there is this 
        ideology some people have. They feel when you dream too big, 
        you are dreaming going beyond the imaginable, like when you 
        are dreaming, you should restrict yourself from going beyond 
        your horizons. Like, imagine things that would actually work 
        out, that are feasible. However, we have a lot of people that 
        dream and they dream beyond the horizons like they, dream far 
        and wide. Do you think such people, 
        their dreams usually come true or it just goes down the drain.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> I believe that its not so much about dreaming 
        but more, what are you dreaming about. It’s not so much about 
        wild dreams, having imaginations, just dreaming here and there. 
        <br><br>
        I believe that this whole world, human race, 
        we are all little pieces in a large puzzle, we all have a 
        reason why we are here, we all have that little piece that 
        we have to add to the puzzle to make it all work out. We are 
        all moving to a destination and we all have a part to play in 
        the puzzle. For somebody, it is to find a cure to corona, for 
        some other person, it is to create microsoft, for some person, 
        it is to assist or motivate the person that was to start 
        computers. <b>Its not so much about dreaming wildly but 
        understanding your purpose, having direction about your purpose, 
        understanding what drives you, what makes you tick, what do you 
        do and you are motivated all by yourself, you don’t need external 
        motivation. You start doing it and you don’t stop.</b>  
         <br><br>
        If you are dreaming in the lines of this, 
         if you are dreaming in line with your drive, your passion 
         and with what you believe is your true purpose, yes. I believe 
         that you can make it and it is not so much just dreaming but 
         also working. You are diligent, you are consistent, you are 
         also determined.
        <b>Sometimes, determination may fail because it is not looking 
         good but that you just continue, it doesn’t matter that you 
         are doing the big things but inasmuch as you are still doing 
         the small things, that you are still doing it is enough.</b> 
        <br><br>
        Don’t just dream but dream in line with your drive, dream 
        in line with your purpose, be consistent, make little moves. 
        If you are consistent and diligent, 
        Yes, I believe that you can make it, you will make it.
        <br><br>
        <b>Host:</b> I actually quite agree with you on what you said. 
        Its not really about dreaming big, its about what you are 
        dreaming about. You have to dream in line with what you are 
        called to do and that way, purpose discovery even comes into 
        play. You must know what you are here for so, you can dream 
        in line with that. Most definitely once you are on that path, 
        things will work out.
        <br><br>
        How do you think a person can dream big and not let it distract 
        them from the present?. 
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> <strong>One, our old people say that a bird in hand is 
        more than two, ten, hundred, one million in the field.</strong>
          The fact 
        that you have one in your hand, <b>you have that one already, you 
        have caught it already. Hold it. You are looking for the one in 
        the field, you are positioning your bow and your arrow. Do well, 
        position it but don’t loose the one in your hand because you are 
        going after ten in the field.</b> So, I would say that while we are 
        going after what we want, first we need money to finance our goal 
        so, we don’t treat the one we have somehow because we are going 
        after something. You know, there is twenty-four hours in a day but 
        there is a way that we can schedule our time that we create time 
        for our goal and our present. <b>Its really important not to neglect 
        the present and what we have when we are chasing after our goal.</b>
        <br><br>
        The second thing I will say is… its also very popular “wisdom is 
        profitable to direct” and it goes back to the first one which is 
        you don’t have something already and because you are going after 
        something else that you don’t know the journey towards that 
        something else. You don’t know what you will meet on the way while 
        you are getting that something else. You now neglect this one that 
        you have. You might loose it and in the end be left with nothing at 
        all so, 
        Yes, wisdom is profitable to direct I would say.
         <br><br>
         <b>Host:</b>I feel <b>it’s 
         the things you do now that will lead you on to that future you 
         are actually hoping for</b> or you are dreaming big about. You are 
         making an impact in society, helping people and all but then 
         your mind is just on that dream meanwhile at the moment, there 
         is no concrete thing on ground that you are doing that will 
         actually help you get to that point. For example, I could say 
         maybe ypou want to build an NGO, you want to build an orphanage 
         in the future, maybe your goal is to cater for a hundred thousand 
         children every month. 
         <br><br>
         If you are not working towards it now to ensure that you become 
         financially free, <b>if you don’t have concrete goals that will help 
         you achieve that thing in the future currently, that actually means 
         that you are letting that future distract you in the now.</b>  So, 
         I feel just like you said, 
         the now is more important than the future.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b>In a way… so, there is a way to channel your now. 
        I feel like you have to find a way that your now can finance your 
        future. <b>What you have now, find something in it that can help you 
        get what you want in the future.</b> I’m going to give an example, 
        <br><br>
        while I was back home, I was working, I had a nine to five job 
        and I also was trying to do my masters. I was saving money, more 
        than half of my salary every month. At the time, when I started 
        saving, I didn’t know that I would use all of it for financing my 
        blocked account. In the end, the money was not enough but at least, 
        I had something. At the time, I had over one million naira. 
        I started doing mutual funds and got to know about mutual funds in 
        the bank that I was working in. I used the knowledge I was getting 
        from my “now” to work towards my future. I was at work, if I was on 
        break, I would go, quickly do something. Sometimes, I would tell my 
        boss I want to take my break outside today. Normally, everyone 
        takes their break in the office and the cleaner would go get 
        something and come back. Sometimes I would say I want to go 
        outside and eat today. I’m not going to eat. I’m going somewhere. 
        Maybe I want to go and certify a document. I would quickly run, to 
        the lawyers place, go and certify document.  I was using my now to 
        prepare for my future. 
        <br><br>
        You have to find something in your now that 
        can help you for your future. You have to find a space in your now 
        to prepare for your future but at the same time you can’t neglect 
        your now. Its very important that you hold that your now very 
        strongly. In that my now, I was still doing performance appraisal 
        and I was doing very well in my performance appraisal. I was 
        getting you know, review and my salary was increasing in my now. 
        So, <b>I was doing it with all of my heart. But at the same time, 
        I found something in my now that was able to help, 
        that I channelled towards my future.</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>Host:</b> Can you outline some steps a person must 
        take to turn their big dreams to a reality. 
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> I think that <b>the first step is that you already 
        have a dream. I believe that’s the pivotal step.</b> 
        That you already have a dream, that you already have a goal. 
        I believe that the next one would be,  That you <b>have a clear 
        plan on how you want to make that happen.</b> This plan may not be 
        the clearest plan that ever existed in the world but at least, 
        it is clear to some degree. 
        <br><br>
        You pick pen, put pen to paper and you say okay, by march, 
        this is what I want to have achieved and this is how I plan 
         achieve it. So, you make very clear plans and realistic plans. 
         I will say that is one and two;  <b>Collaborate. When I say 
         collaborate, I mean don’t be in isolation.</b> So, we have this 
         believe that if you tell people about what you want to do or 
         your plans or something, they will spoil it for you. At the 
         end of the day, if you keep everything to yourself, you won’t 
         get any help. You will have no help at all. So, I believe that 
         at the end of the day, <b>be deliberate, 
        be intentional about the people that you collaborate with.</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>That thing that they say don’t tell people your plans, there is 
        wisdom in it. This is because you can’t tell everybody but be 
        intentional about who you tell.</b> Don’t just talk for carelessly. 
        Be intentional about the kind of conversations that you have, 
        and be intentional about the people that you want to have these
         conversations with. I think that, that would really help, that 
         you have a very clear plan and you collaborate. 
        <br><br>
        And, <b>start small.</b> If you want to build a house, if that’s your 
        goal or maybe you want to be a Landlord and right now, you have 
        nothing. Well, I would say that is a very far-fetched goal. 
        Seeing as you don’t have anything and you want to be a Landlord. 
        Perhaps the meaning of starting small for someone like that 
        would be get a job and start saving. If for example, you wanted 
        to own a juice producing company. Maybe you should start 
        producing juice manually and packing it manually. So, start 
        in the smallest way. If you cannot afford to buy bottles, maybe 
        use nylon bags. If you cannot afford to buy nylon bags, well, 
        maybe open somewhere and have reusable cups that you are washing 
        and serving people and reusuing. So, I would say you don’t have 
        to have everything all figured out. You don’t have to have all 
        the money in the world but start in the smallest way. 
        <br><br>
        So, <b>here is the thing, as you start, other doors start to open.</b> 
        People see you and they start to contribute to what you are 
        doing. People see you and they cannot contribute but they have 
        ideas for you, they will contribute ideas.
        People see you they contribute suggestions, they will give you 
        feedback, they will tell you, but you can do this ths way, it 
        will be easier. Things you didn’t know before, people will 
        introduce you to this things. The most important part will be 
        to start, just start, no matter how small, just start.
         <br><br>
         <b>Host:</b> Do you have <b>final words?</b>
         <br><br>
         <b>TWTsBlog:</b> My final words would be something that is 
         personal to me and something that I apply in my life. 
         The scriptures says, (I am a Christian) <b>by strength shall no man 
         prevail.</b> This is something that I hold dear to me. <strong> It does not say 
         that man does not need strength. It says that By strength shall no 
         man prevail. So, what I understand from that scripture is, you are 
         going to need your strength but it is not that strength that will 
         give you success.</strong> It says good success, all good success comes 
         from God and there is a difference between riches and wealth. 
         So, I would say that as final word to anyone, you have a dream, 
         you have a goal. Hold God and don’t just hold God, hold the 
         principles of God’s Word. So, there is one thing that is God, 
         believing in God, there’s another thing that is the principles of 
         God’s Word. When you read the bible, you get a revelation of some 
         principles in the scriptures. For example, the principle of 
         hardwork, the principle of diligence, the principle of consistency 
         and you don’t just get exposed to these principles, you receive the 
         strength to put these principles 
         into action, to actually live out these principles.
        <br><br>
        So, I would say hold God, and hold the principles in the Word of God.
          If you do know the bible, 
          if you do know the principles of God’s word, they are principles 
          that will help in business, in 
          living a fulfilled life, in growth, in marriage. They are actually 
          principles that will 
        help in all aspects of life so, that would be my final word.
        <br><br>
        I hope you found this insightful.
        Please share with someone that needs to read it.
        <br><br>
        Much love! Besos!!<br><br><br><br>
