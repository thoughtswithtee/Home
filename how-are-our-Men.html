        <br>
        This is how this started. 
        Recently, very very recently. 
        I was chatting with a friend. One thing led to another 
        and he shared that he was depressed. First response was
         I didn’t believe him because my perspective went:
        You, fine boy, sweet boy, babes love you, like… a really
         cool dude. (If someone is fine, let’s say it. Don’t 
         take this the other way. I am just saying what it is, 
         that’s all.) We were talking and He was like… ah, He is 
         actually depressed. That was difficult to believe because 
         He is an intelligent person, he has lots of friends, 
         everything seems like everything is going well. So what 
         can be the problem?...
        <br><br>
        He said that’s the way it looks and 
         the thing is most times when you tell people that maybe 
         you are depressed as a guy, first of all, they won’t even 
         believe you and even if they do believe you, its like no 
         one really wants to acknowledge that truly something may 
         be wrong. He said most times people concentrate a lot on
          women with all these women empowerment talks and no one 
          actually does anything for men. 
        <br><br>
        This made me pause to think a little. <b>The question 
        stood in the air, what are we actually doing for men, 
        young men?.</b> In a conversation with another friend, I asked,
         Are we doing anything to check for their mental 
        health?. 
         “A few guys had commited suicide lately, the most recent
          suicide had been from guys. Not that females hadn’t 
          been commiting suicide but that the most recent ones 
          had been from guys.”
          <br><br>
        She interjected that it had come especially “from guys 
        whom one would never think of doing such a thing”. Guys 
        that look very okay and then its like they commit 
        suicide. why?, what happened?
        The male friend I had the initial conversation with 
        happens actually to know one of the guys that commited 
        suicide so he really felt it. He was like… He is also
         depressed and He doesn’t know what was in the mind 
         of the guy who eventually commited suicide. The ultimate 
         question I posed to this friend was  “what do you think 
         is the issue? What could be the problem with our guys?”
        <br><br>
        She shared that <b>we expect so much from 
        guys that we never see them to be "like weaker vessels".</b> 
       Guys are bigger babies on some level. No offence intended 
        to guys reading. We expect so much from guys that we want 
        them to have everything sorted out. We don’t want them to 
        feel down, we don’t expect them to feel down. That is what 
        an average lady expects from a guy. I added that this 
        expectation comes even from the society as well. This she
         agreed to and said when she relates with guys, although 
         not all the time, she expects that they have everything going.
         <br><br>
          When she hears something like “I’m down”, she goes “which down? 
          Oga, park” and doesn’t take them seriously when they say 
          some things. That was a valid point which I agreed to. We 
          refuse to allow them acknowledge or we refuse to acknowledge 
          that they actually might not be okay emotionally or mentally. 
          We don’t let them… like even if a guy says “I am not…” one tends
           not to agree. She added that we don’t take them seriously and 
           she has so many guy friends that try to share their emotional 
           state but she goes “oga, park, who are you deceiving”
        <br><br>
        This was exactly my first reaction when my friend 
        tried to share that he was depressed. My response was 
        “what’s wrong with you? Stop playing joor. You, how 
        can you be depressed?. This is what they encounter 
        everytime. No surprises there, they don’t like to 
        speak up. Have you noticed?
        <br><br>
        She added "if I am coming to meet you as a guy,
         and you already know that I expect so much from you. 
         Not necessarily funds, not necessarily emotions. 
         It can just be any kind of expectation, I expect 
         you to have something, everything figured out to 
         be 100 percent on the edge. And you on the other hand, 
          are feeling so down, low, 
         you are already getting or feeling depressed and 
         you are looking at this girl that this babe is 
         expecting so much from me. 
         <br><br>
         How will I bring myself 
         to that level to now open up to her? She will not
          even take me seriously". This makes so many guys
         keep to themselves and they don’t share how they 
           feel, they don’t share their emotions and its not 
           surprising that we see so many frosh guys killing themselves now.
        <br><br>
        (I mumbled, “Please o, let our husbands not go and kill
        themselves oo. She jokingly replied, my husband don’t kill 
        yourself oo, I’m here for you oo, I am not expecting anything 
        from you oo . I’m here)
        <br><br>
        She commented concerning the last guy that committed 
        suicide, this guy is fine, he has a business. We 
        focus on everything physical but no one knows what 
        was going on. I agreed that we don’t know what is 
        actually going on because they don’t have any place 
        to unburden, no conducive environment. She agreed that
         there was no landing ground for them.
        We exchanged that the family expects, the girlfriend
         expects and themselves want to be “The man”. There’s also that ego.
         <br><br>
        TWTsBlog: thank you for saying that, the things that are 
        in my mind to say, you are just… God bless you for me.
        <br><br>
        Guest: O pi pi; o pi pi. (chuckles, sorry)
        (we both laughed)
        <br><br>
        TWTsBlog: But you see, also the ego is featuring. 
        They also want to maintain like… I’m doing alright. 
        But I feel like there is more we probably can do to 
        make them feel at home enough to come out and express 
        <br><br>
        Guest: suffering and smiling
        <br>
        TWTsBlog: I feel like sometimes they are working so 
        hard but sometimes, our guys are not very certain about 
        how things will eventually turn out. Some of them are 
        entrepreneurs, there is pressure of business and there 
        is also that pressure to maintain what it looks like(appearances),
         people think they are successfull
         <br><br>
        Guest: so even when it is not going well, they still 
        have to keep up with that same look that 
        “Oh, I’m okay, everything is moving smoothly”
        <br>
        TWTsBlog: They don’t talk, there’s no place to 
        talk even if they wanted to and no one is actually asking.
        <br><br>
        Guest: Well, there could be a place to talk if… 
        I know that we are not trying to play the game 
        here but most of the time, there is always a 
        landing ground for guys but they have messed it up and… 
        once you mess it up, you will now be looking for who to… 
        The lady that was available, not necessarily someone you 
        are dating, can just be a very close friend, you have 
        used one thing, one thing, one thing to destroy that relationship.
        <br><br>
        Do not do anything based on your now, do everything 
        based on your tomorrow because you don’t know when 
        you will meet this particular person so always think 
        of the future before you, you know, make any step or take 
        any step or take any action think of tomorrow, what will 
        happen? Will I still be this same person? Will I need this 
        kind of relationship? Just think of your tomorrow and don’t 
        focus on jayejaye for now.
        <br><br>
        TWTsBlog: Just the way the bible says before God made the
         woman, He said he does not want the man to be alone 
         so, He made a help, He made a support that was meet, 
         that was suitable for him. So God literally made a 
         suitable support for Him. But now, the guys are now 
         just turning the women to chop and go enterprises 
         meanwhile, this is support that you need.
         <br><br>
        Guest: very very wrong.
        <br>
        TWTsBlog: And I just feel like even apart 
        from the relationship area, I feel like just 
        generally as females, I really strongly feel 
        like its our duty whether we realize it or not to support our male counterparts.
        <br><br>
        Guest: Its our duty to help you people o
        <br>
        TWTsBlog: Its our responsibility to help them.
        (we both laugh). The only problem is that I 
        feel like ladies approach guys with the mind of 
        get something from them
        <br><br>
        Guest: Yea, most ladies actually, not all
        <br>
        TWTsBlog: Yes, most ladies. But even on a 
        friendship level sometimes, ladies still 
        relate with guys on the level of get something 
        from them. And I feel like this is not just ladies, 
        this is a human thing because also, guys approach
         ladies with the idea of get something from them.
         <br><br>
        Guest: Amo (however), today we are focusing on our weaker vessels
        <br>
        TWTsBlog:(laughing) Na she talk am o, its not my voice.
        <br>
        Guest: But thats just the truth
        <br>
        TWTsBlog: But its the truth. Although they have this hard front.
        <br><br>
        Guest: We are not talking about the physical 
        muscle you guys are carrying about or your beard.
        <br>
        TWTsBlog: And the face
        <br>
        Guest: We are talking about the inner part, inner part. 
        Like an average lady is way stronger than an average guy.
        <br><br>
        TWTsBlog: yea, on the inside… and really, 
        its our responsibility so…
        But what do you think we can do differently?…
        <br>
        Guest: Ha….
        <br><br>
        TWTsBlog: I feel like we are 
        doing the first thing already
        <br>
        Guest: Which is…addressing? 
        <br>
        TWTsBlog: Which is recognising.
        <br>
        Guest: that you guys got a problem
        <br>
        TWTsBlog: Yes, and addressing it
        <br>
        Guest: I would say that the best thing we can do 
        as ladies is to see every guy as our equal
        <br>
        TWTsBlog: (clap)s, please, bottle of cold juice… 
        very cold pepsi
        <br><br>
        Guest: so whatever I am going through, I expect 
        that you go through the same thing. So whatever 
        I feel, I know that this person also feels that way. 
        So, I should just see you as my equal, that way 
        you would even be able to relate with me and 
        open up to me. You would share things that you are 
        going through because you know that oo, this lady 
        doesn’t expect me to be perfect. She does not 
        expect me to have it all settled one hundred 
        percent. She sees me the way she sees herself 
        like… so I can open up and you know relate with 
        you and I think… yea, thats what every lady out
         there needs to do.
         <br><br>
        I mean, when it comes to marriage, the man is 
        the head of the family bla bla bla…we know all 
        those stuff, but right now, we are talking 
        about when it comes to relationships especially 
        with what guys are going through right now. 
        Committing suicide… like… I know that girls do 
        that too but guys that do it now, it baffles me 
        because these guys all look perfect on the outside…
        <br><br>
        TWTsBlog: …and some may never commit suicide but 
        that don’t mean that they are very alright
        <br>
        Guest: there are still lots of depressed guys out there
        <br>
        TWTsBlog: some of them are actually carrying burdens
        <br>
        Both of us: yes… 
        <br><br>
        TWTsBlog: So, you’ve made two very valid points, 
        a male to a female, a female to a male, you don’t 
        have to be the boyfriend or girlfriend or wife 
        or anything. You are a female. I feel like you 
        have a responsibility… sorry. When we were made, 
        we were made to be a support that was suitable. 
        We must recognise, they are weaker.
        No 1. Equal (not in any kind of position but in being human)
        No 2. Remove expectations. Remove any expectation, 
        you want to get this from him…,No. Treat him like a
         human, just like you are, just like yourself.
        <br><br>
        Guest: I think its high time we started taking these 
        guys seriously when they open up to us.They might 
        say it in a very “jokingly” way… like they might 
        not be serious with it like… oga, I am down o abi… 
        babe, I’m just tired of… and you just say “how can 
        you be tired of…” let’s take them more seriously 
        and give them our listening ears, that’s what they need. 
        These guys will not tell you these things intoto (in-depth)  
        because of their ego which is something we are going to
         address on another. Yes, your ego… hmm… its not that
          its not good o… but sometimes, it does more 
          harm than good, that’s it
          <br><br>
        TWTsBlog: acknowledge them… like… allow them 
        feel at home with you. When they start feeling
         at home, you see that burden they are carrying,
          they will let it out
          <br>
        Guest: They will lay it at your feet… but you’re 
        not Jesus… but they are gonna lay it at your feet
        <br><br>
        TWTsBlog: I’ll just add one more thing. 
        Create boundaries. Hmmm… Its not that you’ll say 
        you are caring about him, its not that you’ll say
         you are treating him as your equal, you are this, 
         you are that, you are creating a conducive environment. 
         Next thing we know, you people are… it has turned to another thing
         <br>
        Guest: carry belle
        <br>
        TWTsBlog:I did not even…
        <br>
        Guest: Wisdom is profitable to direct
        <br><br>
        TWTsBlog: I do not even know….Some people will say 
        they are smart, but that don’t mean y’all have 
        to end up in bed together, No. Just recognize 
        it as you are treating him as a human being, 
        as an equal, as you would treat a fellow female 
        that is your friend. You don’t approach a fellow female
         because you want to collect money from her or 
         because you want to sleep with her or something…  
         except you are "Lez". 
         <br><br>
         So, please relate with them 
         just like… just like your fellow female, just like a human, 
         just like a human really. Create boundaries, 
         You are not in this so that you can sleep with him, 
         you are not in this so that you guys can kiss, 
         you are not in this so that he can give you money. 
         You are in this because he is a human.  So please, 
         just like she has said, lets recognize our men, let’s 
         acknowledge that they are not… hmmm.. 
         I hope that you have enjoyed this chat.
        <br><br>
        I really feel like this chat spoke to me, 
        because…hmmm… before I had this conversation 
        with this guy.. I have quite a number of male friends 
        and I’m always like this with them…like… I would…  
        they would tell me…and I’ll be like… you… 
        you are not alright. Although, once in a while I 
        actually do listen, once in a while… when we get really 
        really close, I actually do listen but most times I’m like… 
        let me hear word joor, you jo…mtchew… I always dismiss it… 
        but yea, I think this is a call to me to change and to everyone of us.
