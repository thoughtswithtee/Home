        <blockquote><strong>“Sarcastic pause… bombastic side eye… No, 
	go and marry God. So, this guy is saying that men do not go into 
	relationships for love. Men go into relationships as some sort of 
	business transaction. Not necessarily business with paid money 
	but business in which they have something they want to get from 
	that relationship/person and that’s why they want to go into that 
	relationship.
	<br> "Partnership… (this possibly means connection), 
	business, investment, its like buying stock"<br>
	(leaves the conversation, say what? Buying what? 
	you don’t say… mouth agape… recovers) No, this is in your head, 
	this is what you think, this is what you want to get out of it but 
	I’m talking about how your heart feels towards them.
	 </strong></blockquote>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Your heart beats for that person…
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> My heart beats for God you know…
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Sarcastic pause… bombastic side eye… No, go and 
	marry God. So, you see what this guy has been saying is that men 
	do not go into relationships for love. Men go into relationships 
	as some sort of business transaction. Not necessarily business 
	with paid money but business in which they have something they 
	want to get from that relationship/person and that’s why 
	they want to go into that relationship.
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> You feel that… its love, its like… but we men, e 
	get why
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> How many relationships have you been in? 
	Relationships that you were serious about
	<br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> I’ve been in like… three
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b>  And in these three cases, you didn’t love them, 
	it was not love that made you go into the relationship
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> Its not “emotions”. Love is a natural thing, every 
	man chooses to love differently. You can have “feelings” for people
	 but it does not necessarily lead to marriage. The kind of love 
	that leads to marriage grows. Its not the foundation.
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Your first relationship, why her? If you now start
	 telling she was intelligent in class, I will tell you that there 
	was more than one intelligent person in class, 
	if your heart wasn’t involved, why her?
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> I’m not saying the heart is not involved, 
	I’m saying love is not…
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> So, what name do you use to describe what 
	you feel in your heart?
	<br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> Partnership… (this possibly means connection), 
	business, investment, its like buying stock
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> (leaves the conversation, say what? Buying what? 
	you don’t say… mouth agape… recovers) No, this is in your head, 
	this is what you think, this is what you want to get out of it but 
	I’m talking about how your heart feels towards them.
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> If you say “emotions”, that’s not the only person 
	you feel something for… <b>let’s use the word like, I like this 
	one because of these special features, characters or these special 
	abilities different from these other ladies</b>
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Ladies gush over getting married whereas, guys 
	don’t have this behavior towards marriage. 
	Why don’t guys feel this way?
      	<br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> Even we men want to spend our lives with you but we 
	don’t obsess over it, we don’t fee it too much.
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Ladies like attention, however some guys can’t 
	wrap themselves around being able to give attention to ladies they 
	are with.
        <br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> Sincerely, a man needs attention too but not on this 
	aspect of… women, I don’t know how God created you guys, you guys 
	are too special, the way you guys want this attention like … If I 
	am talking to you now, you’ll say look at me, you are not listening,
	 you are not…
        <br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Yes now, why will I be talking to you and 
	you’ll be doing another thing?
	<br><br>
        <b>Guest:</b> Maybe I’m trying to get something, I’m 
	actually listening
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Please, look at me when I’m talking to you
        <br><br>
	<b>Guest:</b> If he says okay, let me just… You’ll say, where 
	are you going? Ahn ahn… "una talk no dey" finish? Like… women 
	talk doesn’t finish?
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> It use to finish, what do you mean by that?
	<br><br>
	<b>Guest:</b> It does not because everyday, what you see from 
	morning to evening, you want to download it to the man and he must
	 listen.
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Not everything, No. Not everything. Sometimes, 
	we also have things that we are doing, we don’t have time. Its who we 
	like that we want to share this thing with. Do you see us telling 
	everybody? It is you “gan gan” that we want to tell.
	<br><br>
	<b>Guest:</b> Okay, okay really? Maybe you people should be reducing it?
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> What do you mean by that? you should feel privileged 
	that we want to share this thing with you. Guys out there, please, 
	feel privileged that she wants to tell you about her day.
	<br><br>
	<b>Guest:</b> We are not tape recorders oo (both laugh). 
	We don’t have some external hard disk to carry all this load, we 
	also have issues.
	<br>
	Okay, we want to appreciate all the ladies, to my 
	lady, I am privileged that you are telling me things. At the same 
	time, we have things we think about, if we share it, “
	It is a lot oo, you may not be able to handle it”.
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Please, share it.
	<br><br>
	<b>Guest:</b> I do not mean that you cannot share with your spouse 
	but don’t bring thing everyday
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Its not everyday, somedays, we don’t feel like 
	talking
	<br><br>
	<b>Guest:</b> Even weekends when you take a lady out for leisure 
	or something, they will still want to talk.
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> You know if we didn’t talk, you’ll also ask us if 
	everything is alright.
	<br><br>
	<b>Guest:</b> Yea, because when you are too quiet. When we say don’t 
	talk, you can just talk small. (both laugh)
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Naturally, I feel that when you like someone, 
	you want to spend time with them, you want to share your life with
	 them and this involves telling them 
	about things that’s going on in your life.
	<br><br>
	<b>Guest:</b> Men are not natural talkers (not always true) and you
	 cannot know everything (goes both ways). With men, he may not be 
	open to share everything like a lady would (not always true). It 
	sometimes takes time, he may tell things in bits, he may not just 
	tell everything because he does not know if you can actually absorb
	 it or not and a man needs to defend his woman.
	<br><br>
	If you really care about a lady, you will want to protect her from 
	everything even if that thing will not cause much harm to her, 
	you will still want to protect her.
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Okay, so, I feel the balance here would be that 
	you are aware that she wants to share her experiences with you 
	and you are also aware that she’ll be happy if you shared your 
	experiences with her. 
	If you do care about her, you keep this in mind.
	<br><br>
	<b>Guest:</b> For me, I’m not this talking type, I can play, talk,
	 hype but when it comes to talk, talk, talk, I may not want to be 
	disrespectful and say that the talk is getting long. 
	I like it when you just say A, B, C and end it.
	<br><br>
        <b>TWTsBlog:</b> Summarily, guys may not necessarily be in 
	relationships simply because of emotions, they look more into 
	alignment of goals and personalities. I believe this goes both 
	for guys and ladies. 
	However, likeness many times features on both sides. 
        I hope you found this insightful.
        Please share with someone that needs to read it.
        <br><br>
        Much love! Besos!!<br><br><br><br>
