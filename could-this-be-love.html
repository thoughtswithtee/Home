            don’t let me ask God. However, I just always wanted to know what that

            <br>
            God in His infinite mercy”...</strong></blockquote>
        I’m this person that always knew(as an informational fact) 
        that Jesus Christ loves me, that God loves me. However, 
        I reached a point where I really wanted to understand what that love meant. 
        Okay, Yes, I get it, for God so loves the world. God loves the world, 
        God loves all of us but I wanted to know what that love meant to me. 
        I knew the sentence and I knew the meaning in English… that means God 
        likes you…  but how is this love expressed? 
        <br><br>
        You know love isn’t just you say that you love but you actually 
        do express it through your actions. It just was always at the back 
        of my mind but I was kind of… I don’t want God to think that I’m not 
        grateful for His love, I didn’t want God to think that maybe I don’t 
        think He loves me.. I just had one of the weirdest thoughts in the world, 
        don’t let me ask God. However, I just always wanted to know what that 
        love meant to me as a person.
        <br><br>
        God in His infinite mercy, and there’s something else in the word of God 
        that says in as much as you seek God, He will reveal Himself to you. 
        <b>Here is the thing, the whole time, I’ve been enjoying the love. The 
        whole time, God has been expressing the love to me, I just didn’t 
        recognize that this is the expression of the love.</b>
        <br><br>
        So, this is what I came to understand. It was that there are specific 
        things that God will do to only you as a person that is specific to your 
        situation that will really show that He cares for you and he is concerned 
        about you and really taking care of you and there are specific things that 
        God has already done on ground to show that he loves me, He loves you, He 
        loves everybody. 
        <br><br>
        I just started to recognize those things and I realized that God’s love 
        for me didn’t start from the moment that I accepted Jesus Christ, 
        it didn’t start from the moment that I became born again, it started 
        from before I knew Him, before I was born, like… He already made provision 
        for the things He knew that I would need. Now, that is love and these had 
        been there the whole time, my eyes were just opened and I just recognized 
        it that, that is the love, that is the love girl, that is the love.
        <br><br>
        You possibly know, God created man but man sinned <b>and as a result of 
        this sin, man is corrupted and he can no longer by himself, please God.</b> 
        This is the love of God. Without us asking Him, without us requesting, 
        He already by Himself created a way for us to be able to live according 
        to His design. God created us for His own design and He is saying, this 
        is how I want you to live your life, I want you to be like me, I want 
        you to do good, and not do evil.
        <br><br>
        So, anyone that is doing evil, there  will be destruction to the soul 
        of that person. Cos the bible says that He is the God that is able to 
        destroy the soul in hell. So, the soul that sins will be destroyed in hell at the 
        end of the day. <b>To save us from that destruction,</b> God already created 
        a way to save us. Now, that is love. Actually, John 3:16 says “For God 
        <b>so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. He gave Jesus 
        Christ, that is the way to God.</b> 
        <br><br>
        <b>Jesus Christ is the way that God gave us to be able to come to Him.</b> 
        Whosoever believes in Jesus Christ as the son of God will now have 
        a way. You will be empowered to live in a way that 
        will please God. If that person abides in Christ, you may die on this 
        earth but that second death, you will be saved from it because you will 
        become immortal at the resurrection, you know, at the second coming of 
        Jesus Christ, one is changed by rapture or resurrection and one no longer 
        dies.
        <br><br>
        That’s actually like <b>the ultimate expression of God’s love towards us.</b> 
        Through this expression of His love, there are numerous benefits so let’s 
        say for example, He gives one peace, He gives one joy. That is an expression 
        of the love of God and that is only found in God. So, <b>a human being can be 
        peaceful but there is a difference.</b> 
        <br><br>
        Being peaceful is kind of circumstantial for we human beings but the 
        peace that Christ gives does not depend on our situation. It remains 
        available through troubled situations. <b>You have to ask for it and not 
        just ask, but that you receive it.</b> Once one receives the peace of God, 
        its not circumstantial. Irrespective of the situation, the peace remains. 
        Inasmuch as you let it remain. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Apostle Paul uses the language, it says “let the peace of God reign”. 
        ‘Let’, you have to allow it.</b> Its not like you have the peace of God and 
        you choose by yourself to go and start worrying, No. Cos, the peace of 
        God will be there with you but you have to allow it, you have to let it 
        remain with you. 
        <br><br>
        There is also the joy of God. This joy is like, its not happiness. 
        There is a difference between joy and happiness. Happiness is like, 
        something happens and one is happy. Joy is like, irrespective of the 
        situation, you still just have this joy <b>of the spirit.</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>God is our creator, but in sin, one is not able to come to God for 
        any reason but once one accepts Jesus Christ and becomes born-again, 
        you receive access,</b> you have boldness to come to the throne of grace. 
        <b>Insurance covers you,</b> you can come to God with boldness and then, you 
        can come and ask God, you can come and fellowship with God. God himself 
        will now even speak to you.
        <br><br>
        Another expression of the love of God is that God has mercy on us. 
        You know, sometimes in our daily lives, sometimes, we displease God, 
        sometimes maybe we know what we are doing but maybe for some reason 
        we just still do stuff that will displease God and sometimes we don’t 
        even realize and then we displease God but that gift of Christ helps us 
        to obtain mercy from God. 
        <br><br>
        So, Jesus was going to leave this earth and He said something, He said, 
        I will not leave you comfort-less but I will send the promise of the Father 
        to you. <b>Now, that is the thing about God’s love. God does not wait for you 
        to need it before He makes a provision for it.</b>
        <br><br>
        He looks ahead into the future and He’s like in this moment, you are 
        going to need this thing so I’m going to make a provision for it before 
        you get to that point. That is love. That I don’t wait for you to come and 
        ask me before I make a provision for something. I already can project and 
        see that you will need it and then I make a provision for it. That is love.
        <br><br>
        Now, of course, God has also told us, ask, ask, just ask me. He is not 
        asking you that at that time you are asking, that is when I will go and 
        start looking for it. No, He’s already made provision for it, its already 
        there but He’s like “I’ve prepared it for you”, now, come and ask me. When 
        we ask, He gives us. The bible says, <b>He freely gives us all things.</b> 
        <br><br>
        The gift of the Holyspirit was really, and is just like <b>a very high 
        expression of love in that… you possibly know, the Spirit of God is 
        actually God.</b> Now, He is saying that I will not leave you by yourself to be 
        fighting all these troubles alone I will release a part of myself out, put 
        Him within you, put Him with you and then I am with you always because the 
        Spirit of God is with us always. 
        <br><br>
        He, God releases His spirit upon us such that He can be with us always. 
        Like… I will not leave you comfort-less, I will not leave you teacher-less, 
        I will not leave you guide-less, I will not leave you instructor-less, 
        I will be with you always. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Now, that is the peak of love</b> in that He’s like “I know you’ll need that 
        companionship, <b>I know you’ll need that help that is  present every time</b> because, 
        human beings sometimes will not be there for you. Now, given, God will 
        also send human beings into one’s life to help someone but its like I 
        will give you what you will have at all times because sometimes, human 
        beings may not be there for you. Sometimes, you are even in a situation 
        where human beings cannot be there for you.
        <br><br>
        I just realized because I always knew that we had all these things, 
         but I didn’t recognise them that, 
        that was the expression of love in that before we needed something, He 
        already made provision for it, before we knew Him, He already created a 
        possibility for us to come to Him. 
        <br><br>
        I don’t know what is better than that love in that, He is like… I 
        know you will miss the way, I know you won’t make it so I make a way 
        to bring you out of whatever destruction that you are walking into. I 
        make a way to bring you out of it, I show you that way and all you have 
        to do is just accept it. <b>That’s all you have to do, just accept it.</b>
        <br><br>
        Have you ever been in a relationship?, Have you ever been in love before? 
        do you know how sweet it is for your partner to already think about you, 
        you don’t even have to ask them. They go to get something and they find 
        something and feel “my babe will need this “ and they already get it for 
        you. Do you know how touching that is that they don’t wait for you to come 
        and be asking them, that is the sweetest thing ever, that is kind… that is 
        care, that is love and that is exactly what God did for you.
        <br><br>
        <blockquote><b>This is how God showed his love among us: 
            He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 
            <br> This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his 
            Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. 1 John 4:9-10(NIV)</b></blockquote>
        <br>
        <b>Are you someone that always wondered, what is 
        the expression of God's love then I hope that this helped you.</b>
