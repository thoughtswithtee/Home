        <blockquote><strong>...All this running around dey pack water upandan.
	 Na im dey ginger the storm more. In the first place, the storm na
	 to make you sweat. Reason 
	Jesus wey dey this boat...
        <br>
        ...Jesus called that little faith. Really?? Me calling on you in a 
	storm is little faith? The only issue with calling on Him in that 
	case was that Jesus was in the boat already. Clearly, they could 
	see Him in their boat. And, He was sleeping. 
	I found my first solution here...</strong></blockquote>
        <br>
	The new testament features two storms. Both storms had 
	Jesus Christ and His disciples in them. As I meditated 
	on the two storm scenarios, 
	solutions became evident to me
        <br><br>
        In the first, Jesus and His disciples started a boat trip. 
	From the start of the trip, Jesus was in the boat, on the way, 
	a tempest arose with Jesus still in the boat. However, 
	Jesus seemed unbothered as He was recorded to have been 
	fast asleep on a pillow. The disciples were in a total panic, 
	they eventually woke Jesus up and after He stilled the storm, 
	His response to them was “O ye of little faith”. I saw here 
	then that if them being in a panic and waking him up was being 
	of little faith then being of great faith was possibly to trust Him. 
	Be at peace and just trust Him. 
            <br><br>
        <b>To take one look at Jesus, see Him at peace in the 
	storm and then choose also to be at peace in the storm with the 
	confidence that 
	Jesus is on this boat with me, We can’t drown.</b>.
        <br><br>
        In the second scenario, Jesus told them to go on, He’d join them. 
	As they went, a storm arose. From the Mount where Jesus was, He 
	saw them and joined them by foot as He walked on water to them. 
	The whole time Jesus was on water, there was still a storm. Never 
	mind that they were frightened when they saw Him and Peter 
	attempted 
	to walk on water too but didn’t last long at it.
        <br><br> 
        What I saw in this second storm was that Jesus didn’t rebuke 
	this storm, He simply entered their boat and the storm ceased. 
	One small difference between the two storms was that in one, 
	Jesus was in the boat at the start of the storm and in the other 
	He wasn’t in the boat at the start of the journey.
        <br><br>
        The solutions seemed quite evident then. Cos in the first, the 
	disciples were doing what any sane person would. Try to steady 
	the boat, get the water out, panic a little cos this is real, 
	true danger, call on Jesus, wake Him up. Jesus called that little 
	faith. Really?? Me calling on you in a storm is little faith? 
	The only issue with calling on Him in that case was that Jesus 
	was in the boat already. Clearly, they could see Him in their 
	boat. And, He was sleeping. I found my first solution here. If 
	Jesus was already on your boat when the storm hit then take a cue 
	from Jesus and be at peace. If your chest carry you, sleep even. 
	A deep sleep at that. All you need is confidence in Him and His 
	ability to get you safely to shore. Be at Peace. 
	Your boat won’t capsize with Jesus in it.
            <br><br>
        The other solution was, if He wasn’t on the boat when the storm 
	hit then you need Him on your boat. His entrance into your boat 
	will introduce all the calm you need. It will 
	bring the peace you need, It will still the storm. 
        <br><br>
          In both storms, when they reached their destination, it was a 
	new territory and demon possessed men were waiting at the shore. 
	Also notice that Jesus rebuked the storm in the first story. Its 
	evil spirits Jesus normally rebukes. How come He seems to be 
	rebuking the seas and they are obeying. We can see that these 
	storms were simply oppositions to getting to the place Jesus 
	has given the instruction that we must go over to. 
        <br><br>
          Friend, are you in a situation that feels just like a storm. 
	<b>Maybe its “turningoniown” in popular Nigerian parlance for 
	“turning on its own” and you really don’t just understand again. 
	Perhaps you need Jesus if you 
	don’t yet have him in your life. He brings peace.</b> 
        <br><br>
        Friend if He was in your life when this storm hit, 
	trust His saving abilities and embrace the peace He has already 
	given. (All this running around dey pack water upandan. Na im dey 
	ginger the storm more. In the first place, the storm na to make 
	you sweat. Reason Jesus wey dey this boat, trust Him, be at peace).
